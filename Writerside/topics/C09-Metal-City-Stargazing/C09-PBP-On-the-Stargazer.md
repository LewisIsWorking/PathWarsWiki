## Session 1: Aboard the Stargazer

### Setup

The party is aboard the Stargazer, their spaceship, en route to the planet Aballon. They have a dinner appointment at a bar with their boss, **Professor Tier-99**.

A yellow alert triangle begins beeping on the display screen. Persistent. Annoying.

BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

---

### The Alert

**Arctus** glanced up from tinkering with nearby machinery, drifted over to the screen, and raised a limb to press it.

**Damon** approached the screen, curious about the alert.

**Holis** jerked his head up from where he'd fallen asleep, covering his ears with two of his hands. *"Come on, just another 30 minutes."*

The screen blared both audio and text:

**"ALERT: PIRATE SHIP APPROACHING IN STEALTH. SHIELDS ARE ACTIVE. CHANCE OF SHIELD PENETRATION: 0%."**

The ship's protections were active and working well.

**Arctus:** *"Oh dear, oh dear. The risk seems minimal. Is there any course of action anyone cares to pursue?"*

The ship shook from a laser cannon blast. The screen updated: **"0 damage received."**

The pirate ship continued to blast the force fields. The ship shook lightly. Enough to spill some tea and coffee.

**Damon:** *"Either we just dispose of them, or get right past them. It's not like they can do anything to us in the first place, and I don't really care what we choose to do."*

**Arctus:** *"I don't suppose these pirates are ones for diplomacy?"*

**Holis**, grumbling as he sat up, one hand scratching his head, one his belly, two stretched outward in a yawn: *"Perhaps someone could open a channel and tell them to piss off?"*

**Arctus:** *"I suppose this hypothesis is worth testing."* He fiddled with the comms system, attempting to hail the attacking pirates.

### The Scream

The communication unit opened. And they all heard it.

**The Scream.**

Indescribable. Each of them heard something different.

They did not fare well.

They all passed out.

## Session 2: The Brig (1 Week Later)

### Waking Up

The party awoke together in the Stargazer's brig. All restrained. The restraints required a keycard to open. No other way.

Anything easily removable had been plundered.

**Damon** sighed in relief seeing his mostly organic body intact, but struggled against his restraints in anger. *"Well, whatever the heck happened that knocked us out, it worked, alright. Damn bastards..."*

**Holis** struggled within his seat. *"I don't like this game. I want off this ride."* He attempted to manifest his hologram. Failed.

**Joo-Dee** stirred at the words "missing organs," snapping awake in fear. She checked her prosthetics. Her arm and leg were gone. But her eye remained; the pirates hadn't risked extreme harm removing it. She looked about the brig. *"What happened? I felt the ship shake from some sort of an attack, then some sort of high-frequency signal must have incapacitated me shortly after."*

**Arctus** let out a grumble. *"I will be very displeased if they broke any of my tools."*

---

### The Portal

**BOOOOOOOM!**

A portal tore open: half green flame, half blue flame. The green flickered out; it lost.

Out of the portal came the corpse of a cat-man, a black Pahtra. **Bones**, formerly of C07's Starfinder group. In C07, Bones had fallen asleep in Manee Moonpuncher's shop. The Scream's psychic echo opened a green portal beneath him. The destination was pulled sideways, green flame wrestling with blue, and the portal snapped shut like breaking glass. What arrived in the Stargazer's brig was what remained: flesh charred, half the body stripped to bone with organs popping and frying, the other half transformed into red slime, half-formed and grotesque. The corpse twitched.

**Holis** stopped struggling for a half-second. *"Welp! I do not think they will be helping us."*

The twitching continued, but the creature was clearly dead. A distant alarm sounded. The brig's sensors. Whatever just happened had been alerted to the pirates.

**Damon** watched, horrified. *"What the hell is going on..."*

The portal closed.

**Joo-Dee:** *"What in Weydan's travels just happened!?"* She shunted herself into the closest corner away from the inexplicable horror.

**Arctus** perked up. *"A rather curious phenomenon. I wonder by what mechanism the partial transmutation occurred... If only I still had access to my lab."*

---

### The Door Opens

The brig door slid up, revealing an automaton cleaner.

**Joo-Dee** looked at the open door, then back to the others, and began scooting herself through. *"Now's our... chance!"* she exclaimed between scoots.

**Holis:** *"Well unless you have a super long tongue or other appendage, it would not matter if the corpse had a key."*

---

### The Cleaning Bot

A squat, barrel-shaped thing on treads. Four articulated arms: two scrub-pads, one suction nozzle, one magnetic tool-arm. Its sensor array blinked once, registering the charred remains of Bones, and rolled toward the corpse. It did not acknowledge the party. It began cleaning.

Holis was prompted for a Recall Knowledge (Computers) check. DC 14.

The cleaning bot could not handle the corpse. Going near it caused its circuitry to react strangely, shaking. It tried once more.

**ZAP.** The robot short-circuited and gently beeped. The door opened again.

---

### Ooofy

A figure stepped through. Not the cleaning bot. Taller. Broader. Mismatched plating across the chassis, one arm original factory spec, the other a crude weld-job that hung slightly too long. A dome-shaped sensor array for a head, single row of optical sensors glowing dull amber. A cleaning rag tucked into a belt loop next to a ring of keycards.

Behind Ooofy, a pirate lingered in the corridor. Armed. Laser pistol drawn. Bored expression.

Ooofy looked at the corpse. Then at the cleaning bot. Then at the restrained party. A mechanical sigh, servos whirring like exhaustion.

*"Great. More mess."*

*"Oh. You're all awake. Whatever. Probably will be more mess to clean up. I don't remember one of your friends being a cat man. How did they explode like that?"*

Ooofy crouched beside the corpse, poking at the red slime. Amber optics flickered.

*"This isn't normal residue. This is transmutative. Partial polymorphic collapse. Fascinating. FASCINATING. I wonder if I could... No. No, I shouldn't. That's not my job. I'm just a cleaner."*

Ooofy caught themselves. Stood back up. Grabbed the cleaning rag.

*"I mean. Gross. Very gross. I'll mop it up."*

The pirate in the corridor snorted: *"Just clean it, tincan. And check their restraints while you're at it."*

Ooofy's optics dimmed for just a moment.

*"...Yes. Of course."*

Ooofy turned to the group.

### Status: Ongoing

> Escape in progress. Ooofy is in the brig. Keycards visible.
>> - Party still restrained. Keycard required for release.
>> - Cleaning bot short-circuited near Bones's corpse (Scream energy interference).
>> - Ooofy (sentient automaton, pirate crew) now present with keycard ring. Pirate escort in the corridor.
>> - Ooofy slipped into technical analysis of the corpse before catching themselves. Potential leverage.
>> - Joo-Dee was attempting to scoot through the door before Ooofy arrived.
>> - Ryo's character: stowaway, location TBD (Stargazer or pirate ship). Integration pending VC discussion.
>> - James/Zip: not yet introduced.

> Cross-Campaign: The Scream & Bones.
>> - **Bones** (Pahtra, C07) fell through a Scream-corrupted portal in Manee Moonpuncher's shop. Arrived dead in C09's brig. Half-charred, half red slime.
>> - In C06 Kibwe, **Tal'lysae** sensed the disruption: *"I expected...a cat-man."* Disappointed the transit failed.
>> - The Scream is causing cross-dimensional instability across multiple Starfinder campaigns. The cleaning bot short-circuiting near the corpse suggests residual Scream energy.
