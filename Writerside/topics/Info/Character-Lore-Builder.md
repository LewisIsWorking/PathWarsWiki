> Backstory.
>> - Question: Finally, what is your character's backstory?
>> - Answer:

> Backstory by each Year.

Now find out the current campaign's current in-game year.
For Doomsday Funtime it is currently 4710 AR.
If your character is 25 years old, then your character was born in 4685 AR.

Take each year, put a colon and write what the character did that year, starting with their birth year.
In the above example, it would go like this:
4685 AR, age 0: Born to my parents in Deep-Water.
4686 AR, age 1: The dragon attack on Deep-Water, parents are dead.
... (You would fill this in).
4705 AR, age 20: Achieved first level in rogue.
4708 AR, age 23: Joined the party.

If you have any other questions about this, please contact me on my telegram.

> Beyond the first level.
>> - Question: Are you higher than level 1? What level?
>> - Answer:
>> - Question: What year did your character achieve first level in their class?
>> - Answer:
>> - Question: How long has it been chronological since your character was first level?
>> - Answer:
>> - Question: What has your character been doing since they started adventuring (aka first level)?
>> - Answer:
>> - Question: How did you achieve each level? Aka what did you kill to level up?
>> - Answer:
>> - Question: How long did each level take to achieve?
>> - Answer:

> Time since level 1.

This is a continuation of the 'Backstory by each year' section for if you are starting after the first level.
This section involves writing what your character has been doing since level 1, aka since their backstory.

To do this, you can decide at what age the character became level 1, and what age they are now.
Example:
Level 1 at age 20, level 10 at age 25.
This example would put the character at a progression rate of 6 months to 1 level.
For a human this is pretty normal, but for an elf you may space levels out over decades, longer for some other races.

Assuming level 1 at age 20, that means they came level 1 in 4705 AR.
Now we expand out your 'backstory by each year' section but including 'level x'
after the age of our character before the colon.

Example = 4705 AR, age 20, level 2: Killed my first human and drunk their blood, sanity is starting to leave me...
