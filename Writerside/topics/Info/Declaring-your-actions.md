# Declaring-your-actions

> Saying everything aloud (or in detail in play by post) is essential:
>> 1. If you did not say you did it, then you did not do it.
>> 2. If you do not have the item on your sheet, you do not have the item.
>> 3. If you did not say out loud that you looted an item, then you did not loot an item.
>> 4. If you did not buy an item, then you did not buy an item.

> If I did not hear you say it, it did not happen.
>> - Please make sure I can hear you properly.

> Why is this a thing?
>> - It is to set a standard to avoid arguments where, for example, someone's character dies.
