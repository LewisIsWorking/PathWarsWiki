# Content-warning

Start typing here...

> Why did I add this content warning?
>> - After GMing for a long time, you come to realise that different people have different levels of tolerance for all kinds of different things.
>> - The intent of step 0 is to ensure that you as a potential new player are well aware of possible in-game events, and the types of interpersonal interactions that can occur.
>> - This explanation is for the benefit of everyone as everyone is on the same page when it comes to expressing themselves without fear of upsetting someone else.
>> - While mostly it is just edgy jokes, if any of the possible story elements could make you unwilling to play, then this community / TTRPG experience is likely not for you.

> How Do You Feel About the Permanent Death of Player Characters?
>> - “I am OK with it.”
>> - You need to be OK with the fact that your character may die and that your character may be permanently dead.
>> - While resurrection is often an option, there are many instances where it is not feasible, or the party decides not to resurrect your character.
>> - This needs to be accepted before play can begin.

> How Do You Feel About the Permanent Death of Significant NPCs?
>> - You need to be OK with the fact that significant NPCs may die and be permanently dead.

> Additional: Slavery.
>> - All of the above comes from the RPG Safety kit.
>> - I am adding slavery as my own custom addition as it is part of the campaign world setting.
>> - This means that slavery can often come up.
>> - You need to be OK with:
>> 1. Slavery exists.
>> 2. Players or NPCs own slaves.
>> - This is all I think of in regard to slavery.
>> - If anyone has any suggestions on how the slavery content list could be expanded, please let me know.

> Additional: Comedy.
>> - I have also added this section.
>> - Jokes are subjective, so please be OK with jokes of any kind, any subject, etc.
>> - I, myself, enjoy dark and edgy humour.
>> - However, I know that it is not for everyone.
>> - That is why it is important to acknowledge this and ensure people are prepared for the possibility of jokes being made by anyone involved in the campaign or from the community as a whole.

> Additional: Other.
>> - Per suggestions from players, I will add:
>> 1. Depression.
>> 2. Anxiety.
>> 3. Disabilities.
