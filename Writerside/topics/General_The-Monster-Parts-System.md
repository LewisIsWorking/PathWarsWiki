# The Monster Parts System

**The monster parts system is based on the system from the battle zoo bestiary**

## Basics:

- Each monster defeated can be harvested for "monster parts".
- These parts have a value dependent on power and species of the monster and also have a bulk value (dependent on 
  size).
- These parts can be used to craft items instantaneously.
- The rules: https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=19415&name=Monster_Parts.
- You don't need to use specific parts for specific choices.
- We loosen the rules to have no restrictions on the imbuement or type of items that are craftable in this way based 
on the monster.

## Changes:

- These parts can also be used to create items in the same way from the books that are not runes or rune-based items. 
- Using monster parts to craft an item costs 2x the item's price.
- This is different from crafting as it does not take a skill check or time.

## Benefits.

- The benefit of crafting monster part items is that the item becomes imbued with an imbuement of your choice 
  (limited to the type of item) equal to the level of the item.
- It doesn't cost gold, only the parts harvested from creatures.
