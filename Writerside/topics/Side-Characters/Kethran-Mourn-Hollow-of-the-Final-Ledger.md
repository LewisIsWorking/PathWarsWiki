# Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger

A psychopomp who serves at the Church of Pharasma in Magnimar.

## Appearance

Kethran appears as a plague doctor statue that moves with fluid, otherworldly grace.

- Masked face elongated into a ceramic beak
- Body wrapped in layered robes that move independent of wind
- Carries a staff topped with a soul gem housed in a delicate brass framework.
- The gem contains pale lights that drift like drowsy fireflies
- Carries an old brass clockwork timepiece on a silver chain

## Demeanor

Kethran speaks with precision, often citing exact times and calculations. His voice resonates from somewhere other than his throat—perhaps the staff, perhaps nowhere physical at all.

He is obsessed with punctuality and the proper ordering of events. Being early or late both "create paperwork."

## Role

Kethran serves as a guide within the Church of Pharasma in Magnimar. He led the Heroes of Magnimar through the church to the Garden of Endings to meet with the High Mourner Vara Lamm.
