# Tal'lysae

**Also Known As:** The Red Slime Woman  
**Affiliation:** The Red Flame  
**First Appearance:** Campaign #6 - Kibwe (outside the walls of Kibwe)

---

## Overview

Tal'lysae is a mysterious red slime-woman who appeared before the party when they returned to Kibwe through Eda's portal. She serves an entity she calls "the Red Flame" and has offered an alliance to help save the city.

---

## Appearance

Tal'lysae's form is a disturbing amalgamation—a red, flaming blobby shape with internal components (what may once have been bones and flesh) swirling around her form. She occasionally gurgles and her form shivers and vibrates when agitated.

## What the Party Knows

### Her Origin
Tal'lysae claims that her "divine spirit died" and in that moment of death, she was saved and chosen to become an angel of the Red Flame. She is not from this cycle of time.

### Her Purpose
She has come to offer an alliance:
- The Flame will protect Kibwe
- The Flame will be "seeded" within its walls
- The Flame knows how to reawaken the city's magical wards
- In exchange: "Work with the flame, save the world"

### Her Senses
Tal'lysae appears to have some form of supernatural perception. She recently sensed "a disturbance in the air, a movement in the earth" and declared "this must end."

## What Pidge Revealed (to Kieran)

Through telepathic communion, the demon lord Pidge shared information about Tal'lysae's master:
- Far older than Pidge himself
- Has "bathed in the blood of a billion, billion worlds"
- Committed horrors beyond description
- Wrote it all down in a book—"the chronicler"
- His great-grandson created Lorn

Pidge believes serving this entity may be preferable to the "far worse fate" coming in ten years.

## Lorn's Recognition

Lorn recognised something about Tal'lysae based on his father's memories:
> "You served one of the flames, didn't you?! By saying your divine spirit being dead you mean... that you are not of this cycle, are you?"

He offered his hand in alliance, acknowledging her as "family" in some way through shared connection to the flames.

## Meta Note

> **Out-of-Character Context:** Tal'lysae was originally Lysae, a Fetchling Operative (Sniper) / Rogue (Mastermind) played by @Revan1734 in the Starfinder campaign. When Revan left that campaign, the character was repurposed: the opening of the Kibwe portal simultaneously opened a second portal from the Starfinder universe. Lysae was pulled through and transformed into her current red slime-woman hybrid form.
