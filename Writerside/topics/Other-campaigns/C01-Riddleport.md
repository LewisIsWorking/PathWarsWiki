>> - Yaseitori. Flurry Ranger and Monk.

> 2025-09-10th.
>> - The party are in St. Caspian's Salvation.
>> - St. Caspian's Salvation is a temple to Sarenrae.
>> - Most of the party are going to kill Beltias Kreun.
>> - There are 5 rooms/locations of importance.
>> - 1: The hallway inside the temple. The hallway has a door to the room that is the base of the spiral stairs of the bell tower. 
>> - 2: The spiral stairs of the bell tower lead to Beltias Kreun's room below the top of the bell tower.
>> - 3: Beltias Kreun's room below the top of the bell tower. The stairs in this room lead to the top of the bell tower.
>> - 4: The top of the bell tower. There is a bell up here.
>> - 5: The platform outside the bell tower. There was a mechanical magic rope ladder that leads down to the ground outside of the temple.
>> - The party has jury-rigged the mechanical magic rope ladder to break upon being used.
>> - The party is in the hallway inside the temple.
>> - Lenma Moonshine has just used a loud whistle from the bell tower's platform to signal the party.
>> - This has also alerted Beltias Kreun.
>> - So we are now in initiative. 
>> - Yaseitori is with Moonshine.
>> - The bell tower from bell to ground is 100 feet tall.
>> - The hallway is on the 2nd floor of the temple.

> 2025-09-12th.
>> - Claude:
>> - Based on the context, I would recommend 60-70 feet vertically from the base of the spiral stairs to Beltias Kreun's room. 
>> - Here is the reasoning:
>> - Total bell tower height: 100 feet. 
>> - Beltias Kreun's room is "below the top of the bell tower".
>> - The hallway (starting point) is on the 2nd floor, so roughly 10-15 feet above ground.
>> - This leaves about 25-30 feet from Beltias' room to the top of the tower.
>> - Therefore, 60-70 feet from the base of the spiral stairs to his room provide good tactical positioning while keeping him close enough to the bell platform for story purposes.
>> - Stair rules:
>> - Stairs are difficult terrain for characters moving up them, and shoddy stairs might also be uneven ground. 
>> - Some temples and giant-built structures have enormous stairs that are greater difficult terrain both up and down, or might require Climbing every step.
>> - Difficult terrain:
>> - Difficult terrain is any terrain that impedes your movement, ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to thick ground cover and countless other impediments. 
>> - Moving into a square of difficult terrain (or moving 5 feet into or within an area of difficult terrain if you are not using a grid) costs an extra 5 feet of movement. 
>> - Moving into a square of greater difficult terrain instead costs 10 additional feet of movement. 
>> - This additional cost is not increased further when moving diagonally. 
>> - You cannot Step into difficult terrain. 
>> - Movement you make while jumping ignores the terrain you are jumping over. 
>> - Some abilities (such as flight or being incorporeal) allow you to avoid the movement reduction from some types of difficult terrain.
>> - My notes:
>> - We are using a grid.
>> - Claude calculating how many actions to get to Beltias Kreun's room:
>> - Based on the given information, I will calculate the movement needed:
>> - Distance calculation:
>> - From the base of spiral stairs to Beltias Kreun's room: 60-70 feet (using 65 feet as the middle estimate).
>> - Movement with difficult terrain:
>> - Normal movement: 25 feet per move action.
>> - Difficult terrain (stairs going up): costs an extra 5 feet per square moved.
>> - On a grid, each square is 5 feet.
>> - Moving upstairs: each 5-foot square costs 10 feet of movement (5 base + 5 extra).
>> - Actions required:
>> - Total movement needed: 65 feet = 13 squares.
>> - Movement cost per square: 10 feet.
>> - Total movement cost: 13 × 10 = 130 feet.
>> - Movement per action: 25 feet.
>> - Actions needed: 130 ÷ 25 = 5.2 actions.
>> - Therefore, it will take 6 actions (rounding up) to reach Beltias Kreun's room from the base of the spiral stairs.
>> - Assuming you use your move action each turn to climb the stairs.
>> - My notes:
>> - The party needs to open the door to the spiral stairs room first.
>> - The party are right outside the door to the spiral stairs room.
>> - So Cardigan will step (1-A) to the door, open the door (1-A) and then stride across the room and start climbing the stairs (1-A).
>> - Claude: How far can Cardigan get?
>> - Based on Cardigan's planned actions and movement:
>> - Cardigan's turn breakdown:
>> - Action 1: Step to the door (5 feet)
>> - Action 2: Open door (Interact action)
>> - Action 3: Stride across the room and start climbing stairs (25 feet)
>> - Movement calculation:
>> - Step to the door: 5 feet on flat ground 
>> - Stride across the spiral stairs room: 
>> - Let us assume 10 feet to reach the base of stairs.
>> - Remaining movement for stairs: 25 - 10 = 15 feet of movement 
>> - On difficult terrain stairs: 15 feet of movement = 1.5 squares up the stairs.
>> - Rounding down: 1 square up the spiral stairs 
>> - Result: Cardigan can get 1 square (5 feet vertically) up the spiral stairs on her first turn. 
>> - She will be at the very beginning of her climb, having used her full movement to get into position and start ascending. 
>> - She will need 5 more full move actions (6 total turns) to reach Beltias Kreun's room, assuming she uses her Stride action each subsequent turn.
>> - My notes:
>> - Cardigan does this, the door to the spiral stairs room is now open, and she is 5 feet up the spiral stairs.
>> - Rax asks: 
>> - "So, with my current movement speed, how far can I get up the stairs? I have 35 feet between my hooves and fleet."
>> - Claude: How far can Rax get?
>> - Based on Rax's movement capabilities with the door already open:
>> - Rax's turn with the door already open:
>> - Action 1: Stride to stairs and climb (35 feet total).
>> - Action 2: Stride further upstairs (35 feet).
>> - Action 3: Stride further upstairs (35 feet).
>> - Movement calculation:
>> - First Stride: 10 feet across room + 25 feet climbing = 2.5 squares upstairs.
>> - Second Stride: 35 feet climbing = 3.5 squares upstairs.
>> - Third Stride: 35 feet climbing = 3.5 squares upstairs.
>> - Total progress:
>> - 2.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 = 9.5 squares (47.5 feet vertically) up the spiral stairs.
>> - Since you need 13 squares total to reach Beltias Kreun's room, you would be about 73% of the way there in one turn, needing only 3.5 more squares (1 more action) to reach the top.

> Based on the session notes for the Riddleport campaign, here is how far everyone is up the bell tower stairs at the end of their turns.
>> - In the first round of combat:
>> - Yaseitori: Is already at the top of the bell tower. 
>> - Rax & Necrila: 47.5 feet up the stairs. 
>> - Professor Filiaur Bluestar & Lenma Moonshine: 40 feet up the stairs. 
>> - Sinhow: 32.5 feet up the stairs.
>> - Cardigan: 5 feet up the stairs.

> Round 1.
>> - Enemy turn.
>> - Beltias Kreun's turn.
>> - Beltias Kreun: Speed = 35 feet.
>> - With a speed of 35 feet, Beltias Kreun can open his door and reach the bell at the top of the tower in a single turn.
>> - Here is the breakdown:
>> - • Action 1: Open the door to the stairs. 
>> - • Actions 2 & 3: Use two Stride actions for a total of 70 feet of movement. 
>> - The distance from his room to the bell is about 25-30 feet up the stairs. 
>> - Since stairs are difficult terrain when moving up, this would cost 50-60 feet of movement. 
>> - As he has 70 feet of movement available, he can comfortably reach the bell.
