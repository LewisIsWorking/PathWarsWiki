## Ongoing notes.

> Overview.
>> - The mayor of Magnimar has established a new elite policing division: MagniWatch.
>> - You can issue fines on the spot at certain times using your monument badge.

> The South Hall - Magnimar Menagerie
>> - This expansive corridor stretches between imposing mahogany double doors reinforced with Magnimarian ironwork, their brass handles dulled with corrosion and suspicious stains. 
>> - The hall's vaulted ceiling bears frescoes depicting the city's exotic animal trades, now marred by long streaks of acidic damage that have eaten through paint and plaster alike. 
>> - Along the eastern wall, two massive enclosures stand as monuments to catastrophic failure. 
>> - Their wrought-iron bars, once enchanted with permanent mending and reinforced with alchemical treatments, now display grotesque wounds where something has systematically dissolved the metal from the bottom up. 
>> - The corrosive damage extends in deliberate swaths, as if whatever caused it possessed both hunger and malicious intelligence. 
>> - The northernmost cage resembles a macabre sculpture garden. 
>> - Dozens of petrified rats lie scattered across the floor in twisted poses of terror—some caught mid-flight, others frozen while clawing desperately at the dissolved bars. 
>> - Their stone forms capture the exact moment of their transformation, eyes wide with primal fear, mouths agape in silent screams. 
>> - Fragments of shattered stone indicate that several victims have been trampled or deliberately broken since their petrification. 
>> - The southern enclosure tells a different tale of violence. 
>> - Rotting straw mingles with pungent hyena dung, creating a nauseating cocktail that permeates the air. 
>> - Deep gouges in the remaining bars suggest frantic escape attempts, while dried blood and tufts of coarse fur cling to the twisted metal. 
>> - The acidic dissolution here appears more recent, with edges still faintly smoking and releasing acrid vapours. 
>> - The western wall showcases the menagerie's prized collection of exotic specimens in gleaming glass display cases mounted on articulated brass arms that once allowed for optimal viewing angles. 
>> - Several cases have been violently shattered from within, their crystalline fragments scattered across the floor like deadly confetti. 
>> - The intact cases still hum with preservation enchantments, their magical fields keeping their occupants in suspended animation.
>> - A writhing mass of prismatic centipedes, a cluster of gem-scarabs that pulse with inner light and an unsettling creature called a Zog, its tentacled snout pressed against the glass as it watches with far too intelligent eyes. 
>> - Something terrible has afflicted the hall's remaining inhabitants, transforming them into vessels of pure malevolence. 
>> - Near the southern doors, an almiraj—once a creature of whimsical forest magic—now embodies perverse corruption. 
>> - This oversized rabbit's pristine white fur has taken on a sickly yellow tinge, and its spiral horn gleams with oily, unnatural sheen. 
>> - Pustule sores weep black ichor where some unknown disease has taken hold, and its once-gentle eyes now burn with predatory hunger. 
>> - The creature's breathing creates visible puffs of toxic vapour in the cool air. 
>> - Above, a flash beetle the size of a house cat circles the hall in erratic patterns, its bioluminescent abdomen strobing with diseased light. 
>> - What should be a warm, natural glow has become a harsh, seizure-inducing strobe that casts twisted shadows and makes the petrified rats appear to move in the peripheral vision. 
>> - Dark veins spread across its carapace like a web of infection.
