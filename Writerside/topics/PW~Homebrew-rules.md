# PW~Custom-rules

For the official Paizo homebrew rules we use: [Official-paizo-variant-rules.md](PW~Official-paizo-variant-rules.md).

## 5 plot threads.

Every main character should have 5 plot threads.

These will be created during the conversation between new players and the game master.

## Champions: Healing touch AND touch of corruption!

Champions get both, so they have more fun options in combat!

## Initiative.

Combat starts.

If the party is fighting a boss enemy, then the enemy round is first.

Otherwise, the party round is first.

The party round starts with either the main character that makes the most sense / most cinematic to go first.
Alternatively, the party can strategise who should go first and decide amongst themselves.

When a main character has finished its turn, the player of that character then picks, which main character goes next.
This can be accompanied by an in-character request for help, or a prompt to ask:
- "Sir Lancelot, strike down this ogre!"
- "Cardigan, heal my wounds!"

## Lore Increases.

A lore increase is a skill increase that can only be applied to lore skills.

Every time you get a skill increase as part of your characterâ€™s class progression, you get a lore increase.

This also applies to Rogues with their increased frequency of skill increases.

Rogues get a lore increase every time they get a skill increase.

- 3: Expert.
- 5: Expert.
- 7: Master.
- 9: Master.
- 11: Master.

## Main and side characters.

If the character is controlled by a player, it is a "main character."
If the character is controlled by the game master, it is a "side character."
