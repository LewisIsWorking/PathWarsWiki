> Backstory.
>> - Question: Finally, what is your character's backstory?
>> - Answer: As said, Akwa was born.. or rather found in the archipelago south east of Tian Xia. She was taken by a crew and taken care of. Her continous bond with the seas and water, awakened magical powers within her in her teens.
The crew knew they struck gold with keeping her, so they tried their best to hone her magical powers. 

One time in a cave hidden inside a cliff wall, there 4 pillars arranged in a circle, as Akwa approached, these pillars began to glow, luring her to go to the middle.. which she did. 
A bright light filled the room, knocking her and the crew unconcious. She recieved visions of watery beings, various fish, kraken, otters, seals.. swimming around as if in coexistence. One creature, a large catfish like creature, approached her, swam towards her with an open maw, engulfing her. That's when she woke back up. 
The other crew member looked startled as they saw a mark on her forehead and a catfish right behind her, with the same symbol on its head. The catfish has bonded with her. 

A few years later, crossing the Obari ocean, the crew was caught in a major storm that tore the moon rabbit apart and dispersed the crew members across the ocean, some may have ended up in Jalmeray, others in die Kardaji Bay, while others were forced westwards towards Holomog, Geb and the Mana Wastes, if they even made it so far. 
Since then Akwa has not found her other crew members, but decided to adventure and explore as much as she is able to.
