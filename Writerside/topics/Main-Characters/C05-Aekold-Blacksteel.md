# C05-Aekold Black-steel

> Backstory
>> - Aekold Blacksteel was born in Haldun to Ilda Greyrite and Voltak Blacksteel, his mother (Ilda Greyrite a healer in Haldun) married into the Blacksteel family which has for nearly every generation joined Rahadoums military. 
>> - He grew up hearing stories from his father of the "great" acts his father performed and was inspired by them to become a great and admirable person. 
>> - However at 9 his father died on a hunting trip leaving his mother to raise him. 
>> - Since his father was no longer around, he wanted to look for someone who could help teach him how to fight so he could be like his great father one day. 
>> - Only a few months later Aekold came across an old man his mother was healing known as Lostav Uddrul, an old soldier who was previously part of the Radahoum military. 
>> - Upon recognizing that Aekold was the son of Voltak, an old friend of Lostavs, Lostav took it upon himself to train the eager Aekold in swordsmanship. 
>> - Unfortunately this training only lasted a three years with Lostav becoming bedridden due to a sickness he caught at his old age and only a few months later Lostav had passed away. 
>> - Although somewhat irked at the inconvienience caused by this Aekold found himself more dissapointed by the fact that he was no longer able to be trained by Lostav but still respected the man for his helping him. 
>> - For the next few months Aekold continued to train on his own, and two months before his eighteenth birthday he went to hunt some wild creatures on his own to prove to himself his training this year was worth it. 
>> - For the next month he had spent his time working from lower mountains near Haldun upwards hunting whatever creatures there with a hunting knife, a sword and padded leather to protect himself. 
>> - The first few weeks were merely that of hunting for food and getting used to the harsher air and rough terrain, 
>> - but someday on the third week he had found a cougar feasting upon a creature that Aekold could assume to be a rabid dog. 
>> - Thankfully due to the dimmer light of dusk and loud shrilling of the mountainous bug Aekold had managed to not catch the beasts attention, 
>> - taking advantage Aekold kept his distance to the beast and attempted to get behind it.
>> - However, the dim light had also been to Aekold disadvantage as he had slipped upon the lose dirt of the mountain and while he had caught himself from falling he had caught the beasts attention which had quickly begun rushing towards Aekold, 
>> - and with a quick reaction only from the many years of training and work, 
>> - Aekold had taken a great slash at the now jumping Cougar catching its neck and managing to bring it to the ground with the sheer weight and force behind the slash. 
>> - Managing to fully recover his footing Aekold could finally take in what had just happened and upon realizing he took great pride but however was unconsiously shaking from the fight and when he realized this he didnt think that it was caused from a fear of death but rather an exhileration that he again felt great joy in and had decided to butcher the beast there with his bloodied, shaking hands. 
>> - After managing to butcher the beast and severing its head he finally rested having finally ridden off the high the sky was dark with the moon barely providing a light to see anything in. 
>> - Given plenty of time to think of the events Aekold had finally understood what had just conspired, finally realizing his mortallity but rather than a fear of death he found a great purpose to become not only strong enough to deserve respect from others, 
>> - but respect from beasts and monsters finding no greater joy than the thought that he could one day stand as the highest in not only society but that of nature. 
>> - Returning back down the mountain with the head of the cougar and bloodied gear.
>> - He hung the head of the cougar next to the many heads of beasts and monsters that decorated the wall his father once used to mount trophies upon.
