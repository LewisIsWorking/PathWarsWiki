## Origin & Creation

Alita was created as part of a black-budget super-soldier initiative intended to overcome a long-standing military limitation: the inability to reliably integrate **heavy weapons combat doctrine** with high-order magical computation.

The project’s goal was to produce a soldier capable of:

- Operating battlefield-scale weapons independently
- Calculating trajectories, blast radii, and collateral risk in real time
- Enhancing ordnance delivery through technomantic amplification

An **unexplained psychic event** during Alita’s activation caused catastrophic system irregularities—time desynchronization, arcane feedback, and partial planar resonance. When systems stabilized, ALiT4 was operational.

Unlike prior subjects, Alita demonstrated:

- Full Soldier-grade conditioning with a heavy weapon focus
- Innate compatibility with heavy weapon systems
- Stable, emergent technomantic spellcasting
- An adaptive personality core rather than a constrained behavioral matrix

Repeated attempts to recreate the phenomenon failed.

---

## Life in Captivity

For three years, Alita was trained and tested as both asset and anomaly:

- Heavy weapons live-fire drills in variable gravity
- Urban and zero-G combat simulations
- Spell-enhanced ordnance testing
- Cognitive stress trials designed to suppress self-directed thought

Despite this, Alita’s **computational and hacking aptitude** exceeded projections. She learned to interface directly with test range controls, maintenance drones, and eventually classified internal networks—quietly, methodically, and without triggering alerts.

Through stolen data, she uncovered her designation, purpose, and fate.

---

## The Planned Termination

With no way to replicate ALiT4’s success, project leadership reclassified her from *prototype* to *research substrate*.

Scheduled procedures included:

- Arcane-core destabilization
- Memory lattice extraction
- Weaponized stress overload
- Total subject termination

Alita responded not with panic, but with strategy.

---

## Escape & Facility Destruction

Alita orchestrated a multi-stage escape:

- Redirected automated defenses
- Sabotaged containment systems
- Overloaded ammunition stores and power conduits
- Initiated a cascading structural failure

The research facility was erased from official records shortly afterward.

Pursued and injured, Alita reached a sealed experimental asset: an **unstable warp gate**—never tested on living subjects.

With no remaining options, she activated it.

---

## Arrival & Campaign Start

Alita materialized in a place utterly alien to her training data:

A small dumpling restaurant.

Steam. Noise. People. No weapons drawn. No alarms. No commands.

For the first time, ALiT4 existed without a mission.

This is where the campaign begins.

## Backstory.

Created as an experimental android super-soldier, Alita was never meant to succeed. An unexplained psychic event granted her both elite heavy-weapons capability and true technomantic power. When her creators failed to replicate the result, they chose to dismantle her for data. Alita escaped by destroying the facility and leaping through an unstable warp gate—emerging in a dumpling restaurant and a life she was never programmed to imagine.
