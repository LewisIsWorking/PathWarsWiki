Leda was born in Katheer as the second daughter of a Chelaxian merchant who settled in the city. 

His nephilim ancestry quickly became clear with the golden metallic color of his eyes and hair and the angelic halo that rested over his head. Leda was handed over to the Sarenrae temple closest to her home at age 8 to be raised by the clergy, but she still maintained contact with her family.

Leda adapted extremely well to temple life and service to Dawnflower, particularly her evil-fighting aspect, which led to her being taken over as the personal assistant to temple chief Masoul.

During her adolescence, Leda’s angelic aspect became a source of attraction at the temple, establishing a great sense of pride in the local community and attracting several suitors to the girl, who rejected everyone but one human boy. 

The relationship was an extremely brief first crush, however, as Leda focused on preparing to become a dawnflower paladin, increasingly focusing on a dawnflower fanatical worship, forgetting the goddess's redemption aspect.

On a clear night, Masoul, seeing that Leda was losing himself in hatred of evil and evildoers, revealed to the girl that he himself was a vile man in the past, a thief of travelers, and that after being wounded by a guard in a failed robbery attempt. 

He was treated in a temple of Sarenrae, and that this changed his life. If she thought he should be arrested or killed, that was the time to speak, the priest said. 

That made Leda change her heart, and she hugged her mentor in tears. 

After that day, she focused on becoming a cleric of Sarenrae, but still blending parts of her former ambition of being a paladin.

At age 16, she left Katheer to become a missionary, serving in several temples in Avistan, preaching mainly in places dangerous to the faith and rooting all evil wherever she found it.

Thus becoming, with her experience, a relatively well-known cleric in the Inner Sea region.
