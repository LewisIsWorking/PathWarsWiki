# C06-Lorn

The lore in a nutshell is he was part of the gnoll tribe from the asmodeus hellstorm thing.
He was kidnapped by the black dominion and turned into an eldritch slave.
Selenor finds him and saves him through necromancy.
He spends 1h with Selenor, but he has a hunger for wandering the world, therefore, he leaves him and ends up in Kibwe.

The contract with Ademe dispelled Lorn's Grand Explorer tattoo.

## Post Kibwe.

Lorn was last seen by Selenor on the walls of Eto:
"I am sorry, father."
