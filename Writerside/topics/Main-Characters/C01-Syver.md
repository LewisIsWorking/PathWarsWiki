## Syver.

>> Overview.
> - Class: Gunslinger & Magus.
> - Level: 11.
> - Race: Sprite.

>> Backstory.
> - Syver, formerly known as Elionova, is a draxie sprite who is well over 500 and was born and grew up on the prime plane as a nomad forever wandering until his 10th birthday.
> - Where shortly after his parents vanished, he spent the next 25 years before giving up and becoming an adventurer.
> - They decided to try out a few weapons and stuck with the rifle, and they hunted for the next few hundred years.
> - They never really gained praise as they were more of a background character by choice it was not until that fateful day.
> - When they saw Seraphine getting tossed around by a sea dragon.
> - I could not leave a child to that fate, so I shot the dragon, and since then they became inseparable for around 90 years before going missing.
> - Where I proceeded to drain and liquidate everything I had using every contact and calling in every favour, they were not going to let another loved one vanish into the ether.
> - 40 years later, I found her, but her beautiful pine wings were missing.
> - There I found out they were stolen from her while mine only grew.
> - I felt so much pain for her, they vowed to find her wings or find a way for her to get new wings.
> - I also vowed to stay close to her.

>> Backstory V2.
> - 50 years ago: Awoke with amnesia in the Graveyard of Korvosa (holy graveyard of Pharasma).
> - Bishop Keppira d'Bear taught you magic in the grand cathedral.
> - Went adventuring, got to level 10ish.
> - Along the way rescued Seraphine from a sea dragon.
> - Your birthmark glows brightly, and you get a vision from Pharasma: Selenor will bring the undead doomsday, destroy him and bind his soul.

>> Plot hooks.
> - 1: Destroy Selenor (due to the divine mission) & Griselda (for her crimes against life).
> - 2: Eradicate all undead / Stop undead from being created / Become the greatest assassin / Religion cleansing of deities that oppose Pharasma.
> - 3: Destroy the fae that caused you to lose your memories.
> - 3: Recover memories, find out why they were taken.
> - 3: This may require Ascending to divinity despite Syver not wanting to be divine.
> - 4: Craft the ultimate weapon / major artefact weapon (gun).
> - 4: First, create a level 20 monster weapon (requires level 20 & a LOT of monster slaying + harvesting).
> - 5: Help Amenopheus the ruby sage recover his memories and further his goals.

- Amenopheus tempers Syver's blood rage against Selenor (for now).
