### Rubel's Backstory :
Rubel was born somewhere, he is not sure.

He does not even know that he is the child of 2 famous adventurers who sacrificed their lives to push back against a great threat.

The only thing he is sure of is that after living for most of his life in a small Varisian mountain village
helping his adoptive grandfather and hearing stories of great adventurers and heroes,
he dreams of becoming one.

After his grandfather disappeared and was presumed dead in an accident,
he left his home village and started heading for adventures.
Once he was in a difficult spot fighting a monster way overpowering him. But got saved by a beautiful elven woman.
He fell in love with her but too shy to tell her he asked to become her student. He learned many techniques and general knowledge.
After that her elven mentor had to leave, he swore he would become a great adventurer or even a hero for her and got back to adventuring.

Although he was using magic to fight before, after the Incident with the Grand Explorer's party and the mosquito village.

He seems to have lost most of his spell casting capabilities (for now at least).

He now fights with the various techniques that his master taught him, deceiving his opponents by feigning weakness or redirecting his attacks at the last moment.

Although he may have lost his spell casting skills in this incident, he has not forgotten.
