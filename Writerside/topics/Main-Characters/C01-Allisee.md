## Allisee's telling of her backstory.

Esteemed guests

Today:
we have a special drink for your taste, a one of a kind ‘story tea’ that I have the pleasure of serving you today ...
Although stories are merely fiction, every one of them has ties to reality, but it is always up to the listener to make up his own truth of the matter.

Our short story begins at a party, a birthday for the daughter of a noble family set at their vast estate.

As the party came to an end, the birthday girl and her sister both tired of the party retreated to their usual getaway where they watched the stars. 

However, this night, the sky was void, no star was visible, not even the moon.

Bored by the sight, the birthday girl decided to look elsewhere, towards the forest near the estate; having caught the sight of something, she rushed into the forest to get a closer look. 

Her sister tries to stop her, in vain.

Have you ever been told by someone in your childhood that it was dangerous to go into a forest, especially alone? 

Many would say it is because wild animals are somewhat dangerous, but what if instead, you stumbled upon a coven of hags? 

Hard to believe, right? 

Although it was not hard to believe for the 2 girls, as after the sister caught up to the girl, they found themselves in a small hut in the middle of the forest, surrounded by these same hags. 

And it all happens in an instant, pain, both of them struck by the hags’ magic writhing on the floor, helpless and losing consciousness.

As the next day comes, the only person found by the search party sent to search for them was the sister; although she was forever changed, disfigured, the birthday girl, nowhere to be found, was presumed dead. 

As with all big events, rumours and truth get intertwined, was the sister responsible for the girl's death? 

Is it a plot to be the only heir? 

Was a foreign power involved in the attack?

All those rumours weighing on the sister stirred a feeling deep inside. 

A voice called out. 

An entity, a devil, or something similar, proposed a deal to the sister, a simple one really, a wish for a soul.

This story comes to a close here, with this last question?

What did the sister wish for?
