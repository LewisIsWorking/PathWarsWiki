## Backstory:
> Backstory of Allisee Tra-Umna.
>> - Allisee was born as the daughter of Yubis Dara. 
>> - But she has no memory of her time with her mother as she abandoned/trusted her to her father Treluf Tra-Umna, a human Taldorian noble. 
>> - Some time after that her Father married a human noblewoman Elonia and had a daughter which was designated as heir and the half-sister of Allisee, Lylissee. 
>> - The two half-sisters were allowed to be and play together during their childhood. 
>> - Even if Allisee was not a legitimate child, 
>> - mostly thanks to the intervention of the grandfather of the family who pushed his son to own up to his mistakes and take responsibility. 
>> - During her childhood, 
>> - Allisee often looked up to the night sky, she was already fascinated by the beauty of the moon and stars at this time and spent a lot of nights stargazing. 
>> - Her sister joined in at some point, and before they knew it, they were stargazing together every night. 
>> - When came the day of her sister's 14th birthday (25/04) and after the birthday party, 
>> - the two sisters once again went stargazing this night, 
>> - this time, however, there were no stars in the sky and no moon either. 
>> - Lylissee decided to look around instead since there was nothing to see in the sky. 
>> - She got intrigued by an animal she caught a glimpse of, she ran off into a forest, and Allisee ran after her. 
>> - They followed this animal for quite a while and got deep into the forest. 
>> - They found a small hut where the animal had entered, when they entered it turned out they interrupted a hagâ€™s coven gathering. 
>> - The hag captured them both, but it seems they were not interested in Allisee, 
>> - they left Allisee to die after torturing her and blasting off the left side of her head with magic. 
>> - She was found by a search party sent by her father, she was miraculously alive and in one piece, although she had a sort of scar or burn marks left by the magic. 
>> - Also, a glowing silver eye that replaced her missing one. 
>> - She has very little memory of this event but still remembers her sister being taken away. 
>> - After this day, things changed, she was blamed for what happened (being the older sister) and even if she was not physically abused, 
>> - she was put under a lot of mental stress... Which ultimately led her to forming a pact with a mysterious shadowy entity. 
>> - Realising that something was up (maybe), her father sent her to the Eastern front Academy to study magic.
