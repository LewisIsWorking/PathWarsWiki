Plot hooks.  <br/>
You do not need to answer any or all of these, but please come up with the plot hooks your character's story revolves around.  <br/>
Part 1 of 3: What are (at least) 5 accomplishments your character wishes to achieve? Examples include:  <br/>
Question: What is a personal milestone your character dreams of reaching (for example, mastering a skill, unlocking a power or finding their calling)?  <br/>
Answer: Finding out what The Traveler truly wants of them.  <br/>
Question: Does your character have a relationship they want to build or repair (for example, with a family member, a mentor or even an estranged enemy)?  <br/>
Answer: They would like to be able to travel with their friend Chik again, but realize that is unlikely to happen.  <br/>
Question: Is there a location they have always wanted to visit or conquer? Why?  <br/>
Answer: All of the great mysteries of the Pact World systems call to him, Salvation’s End, the Threshold Enigma, the Ghost Levels.  <br/>
Question: Does your character have an ideal legacy they wish to leave behind?  <br/>
Answer: They want to discover something that makes a positive difference for all life in the galaxy.  <br/>
Question: What is one immediate, achievable goal they are pursuing right now?  <br/>
Answer: To get to Aballon Station to find out what The Traveler is seeking, and to figure out why he can suddenly see ghosts - and it all seems to be tied into these Screams.  <br/>
Question: Is there a wrong they feel compelled to make right, either for themselves or someone else?  <br/>
Answer: They tend to have a bleeding heart for those in need as it is, and exposure to ghosts with tragic pasts might also mean he will have a lot of windmills to tilt at soon.  <br/>
Question: What is a selfish desire they may not admit to others but secretly want to fulfill?  <br/>
Answer:   <br/>
Part 2 of 3: What are (at least) 3 secrets your character is hiding from the party? Examples include:   <br/>
Question: Do they have a past mistake or failure they are ashamed of?  <br/>
Answer:   <br/>
Question: Is there a relationship, alliance or obligation they have not told the party about (for example, a debt to a villain or membership in a questionable group)?  <br/>
Answer: They don’t like to get into too many details about their relationship with The Traveler, partly because they are starting to wonder if he really is an envoy of Weydan, and partly because they don’t like admitting that they are, ultimately, a servant now, despite their current master seeming to have a beneficent disposition.  <br/>
Question: Are they concealing something magical, cursed or otherwise unusual about themselves?  <br/>
Answer: They like to present their patron’s relationship with them as “working together,” because admitting that they are bound is slightly embarrassing to them as a sarcesian. They are also likely to keep their ability to see ghosts to themselves for the time being, or at least until it becomes relevant to discovering what caused them to develop those abilities in the first place.  <br/>
Question: Do they harbour feelings of jealousy, resentment or distrust toward a party member? Why?  <br/>
Answer: They don’t know any of them yet.  <br/>
Question: Is there an ulterior motive behind their reason for adventuring with the party that they have not shared?  <br/>
Answer: They might not share their mission from the Traveler immediately, and may try to come up with some other excuse for why they are on Absalom Station.  <br/>
Part 3 of 3: Try to tie in (at least) one thing (it can be anything) with another member of the party. Examples include:  <br/>
Question: Does your character have an unspoken grudge or tension with another party member?  <br/>
Answer: Don’t know them yet.  <br/>
Question: Are their goals or ideals incompatible with the party's mission?  <br/>
Answer: Unlikely - hopefully they are interested in figuring out what the Screams were as well, which Lowda assumes is part of his mission from The Traveler.   <br/>
Question: Is there anything about their personality that might clash with others?  <br/>
Answer: He would only have issues with those who are pro-undead or those who are willing to throw away or destroy undiscovered knowledge.  <br/>
Question: Are they hiding something that could potentially harm or betray the party?  <br/>
Answer: Not that they’re aware of. Depends on how rowdy these ghosts get.  <br/>
Backstory.  <br/>
Question: Finally, what is your character's backstory?  <br/>
Answer:   <br/>
Backstory by each Year.  <br/>
Now find out the current campaign's current in-game year. For Doomsday Funtime it is currently 4710 AR. If your character is 25 years old, then your character was born in 4685 AR.  <br/>
Take each year, put a colon and write what the character did that year, starting with their birth year. In the above example, it would go like this: 4685 AR, age 0: Born to my parents in Deep-Water. 4686 AR, age 1: The dragon attack on Deep-Water, parents are dead. ... (You would fill this in). 4705 AR, age 20: Achieved first level in rogue. 4708 AR, age 23: Joined the party.  <br/>
If you have any other questions about this, please contact me on my telegram.  <br/>

Lowda Medina: A Life in the Drift
Born: 285 AG  
Birthplace: The Drift (within the prismeni-warped vessel The Resonant Chorus)  
Ancestry: Sarcesian (with Prismeni-Versatile Heritage)  
Classes: Witchwarper 1 / Witch 1 (Aeon Wyrd Patron: The Traveler)  
  
Year-by-Year Account  
285 AG (Age 0): Birth in the Drift  
Lowda is born to Sarcesian parents, Elara and Kaelen Medina, aboard the exploration vessel The Resonant Chorus. The ship, part of a small fleet studying a stable Drift pocket, becomes entangled in a reality-warping event. Lowda is born during this chaos, his nascent consciousness imprinted with the event's psychic resonance. This is the source of his Prismeni heritage—a gift of fractured possibility woven into his very being. The fleet manages to escape, but the experience scars the ship and its crew. The Resonant Chorus is deemed unsalvageable and is towed to a salvage yard in the Diaspora.  
286-288 AG (Ages 1-3): Early Diaspora Life  
The Medina family, along with several other displaced crew families, settles in a makeshift community on a hollowed asteroid within the Diaspora. It's a hardscrabble life, but communal. Lowda's first memories are of the recycled air, the hum of gravity generators, and the warmth of his parents' embrace. His father, Kaelen, is a skilled cartographer, and his mother, Elara, a botanist trying to cultivate fungus in hydroponic bays. Even at this age, Lowda is fascinated by the holo-maps his father draws, his tiny fingers tracing the unknown spaces between stars.  
289-294 AG (Ages 4-9): The Ysoki Creche  
With both parents working long hours to help the community survive, Lowda spends most of his days in the settlement's communal creche. The creche is run primarily by a large, boisterous Ysoki clan who lost their own freighter in the same Drift incident. The Ysoki, led by the matriarch Grandmother Niska, run the creche with a philosophy of "the more, the merrier." Lowda is enchanted by their world. He learns to fix toys with scrap metal, hears tales of their far-flung cousins on Absalom Station, and participates in raucous, multi-species games of hide-and-seek through the corridors. The Ysoki's innate sense of community, their resourcefulness, and their loud, loving family structures become his template for what "family" means. He stays in touch with several members of the clan throughout his life, especially a Ysoki his age named Chik, who becomes his first and most steadfast friend.  
295-299 AG (Ages 10-14): The Cartographer's Son & The First Spark  
Lowda begins formally apprenticing with his father, Kaelen, learning the art and science of cartography. He pores over star charts, Drift routes, and accounts of "The Gap." This is when his obsession truly ignites. He’s not just mapping known space; he’s obsessed with the blank spots, the "Here Be Dragons" territories. He reads everything he can about Weydan, the god of travel, portals, and discovery. The Weydan teachings—"The path is the purpose, the horizon is a lie, and the unknown is the only truth worth knowing"—resonate with him on a fundamental level. He builds a small shrine to Weydan in his family's habitation pod. His parents support this passion, even as it means their son dreams of leaving them. Regular communication via datapads and infosphere messages becomes their norm. Elara sends him samples of new fungi she's cultivated; Kaelen sends him encrypted coordinates of rumored uncharted systems.  
300 AG (Age 15): The Witchwarper's First Step  
At 15, driven by his devotion to Weydan and his desire to see the unknown, Lowda begins his formal training as a Witchwarper. He seeks out a reclusive Sarcesian mystic living in a deeper part of the Diaspora named Xylos. Xylos, a former Starfinder, sees the raw, unfiltered potential in Lowda—the Prismeni energy that makes reality mutable around him. Xylos teaches him the fundamentals: how to perceive alternate realities, how to subtly pull elements from them, and the immense responsibility that comes with such power. Lowda’s first successful "warp" is making a rotten ration-pack apple appear fresh and crisp for a moment, a small but world-shaking miracle to him.  
301-304 AG (Ages 16-19): Early Diaspora Adventures  
Lowda, now a fledgling Witchwarper, begins taking odd jobs on ships passing through the Diaspora. His cartography skills and his burgeoning reality-bending talents make him a useful, if unpredictable, crewmate.
301: He signs onto a salvage vessel, helping them navigate the treacherous debris fields of the Scoured Stars system's outer reaches. He uses his powers to briefly "reality-shift" a collapsed corridor, allowing the crew to access a valuable Azlanti-era power core.  
302: He reunites with his Ysoki friend Chik, who is now a junior engineer on a bulk freighter. They spend a memorable (and slightly illegal) week exploring the abandoned docking spires of Verces, chasing rumors of a hidden pre-Gap data cache.  
303-304: He works as a navigator for a scientific survey team charting unstable asteroid orbits in the Diaspora. During this time, he hones his skills, learning to use his Witchwarper abilities for practical purposes—like creating a momentary bridge of stable reality over a fissure in an asteroid during a cave-in.  
305 AG (Age 20): The Encounter with The Traveler  
Lowda is the sole crewmember awake on a small scout ship, doing a routine EVA repair on a faulty maneuvering thruster. Tethered to the ship, floating in the silent, ink-black void between asteroids, he feels a presence. It isn't hostile, but it is immense. A voice, not heard but understood, fills his mind. It calls itself The Traveler. It speaks of its own endless journey between realms, of the infinite layers of reality, and of the pathetic smallness of the universe most beings perceive. It offers Lowda a pact: the power to see and walk those hidden paths, to truly be a follower of Weydan, in exchange for being bound to a fragment of itself—an aeon wyrd it calls Pulse #423. The wyrd, it explains, will be a companion, a guide, and a tether, ensuring Lowda never gets lost in the infinite possibilities his Witchwarper powers open up. Seeing this as the ultimate answer to his prayers to Weydan, Lowda accepts. A shard of crystalline light seems to pass from the void into his chest, and Pulse #423 manifests as a small, humming geometric shape that orbits his head. He returns to the Diaspora, now a Witch.  
306-309 AG (Ages 21-24): The Archaeologist's Companion  
With the dual perspective of a Witchwarper and a Witch, Lowda's adventures change. Pulse #423 whispers insights about the age of ruins, the psychic residue of their creators, and the dimensional echoes of past events. He becomes a sought-after guide for small-scale xenoarchaeological expeditions.  
306: He meets a team from the Starfinder Society on a dig in the Diaspora, investigating a Jinsul outpost. His ability to perceive the "ghosts" of the outpost's final moments, courtesy of Pulse, helps them locate a hidden armory. He makes contacts within the Society, though he remains a freelance explorer, wary of too much structure.  
307: He has a brief but intense relationship with a human xenobiologist named Renn. They bond over long talks about the origins of life in the universe, and Lowda finds their passion for the why behind life as compelling as his own passion for the where. It ends amicably when Renn takes a long-term research post on Castrovel.  
308-309: Lowda focuses on exploring the more mysterious reaches of the Diaspora. He and Pulse investigate asteroids that seem to "hum" with untapped energy, decipher pre-Gap data fragments left by forgotten races, and always, always, update his father's charts with new, precise data. He maintains regular, loving communication with his parents and Chik, sending them holo-images of his discoveries. Chik often jokes, "You're finding all the good stuff, leave some for the rest of us!"  
310 AG (Age 25): The Threshold Enigma & The Vision  
Lowda's reputation reaches Dr. Aris Vex, a xenoarchaeologist obsessed with the Threshold Enigma—a mysterious, seemingly sentient planetoid in the Phantom Rift. Vex assembles a team of specialists, including Lowda, to mount an expedition. As their ship, the Event Horizon, crosses the threshold into the Rift, an overwhelming, psychic scream tears through the vessel. It's not a sound, but a direct assault of pure, alien anguish and fury. Lowda is hurled from his bunk, slammed against the bulkhead, his mind reeling. Pulse #423 flares with a brilliant, frantic light, shielding him from the worst of it. Several other crew members are not so lucky; one falls into a catatonic state, another babbles in a forgotten tongue, and the ship's captain is gripped by a paralyzing terror. The mission is aborted. Dr. Vex, pale and shaken, orders an immediate return to Farabarrium, the main settlement in the Diaspora, for medical assessment.  
As the Event Horizon exits the Phantom Rift, the psychic pressure vanishes. Lowda, still dazed and aching, collapses into his bunk. In that moment of exhaustion and mental vulnerability, The Traveler appears to him in a vision, more vivid and commanding than ever before.  
"Pulse #423 performed admirably. The scream was the Enigma's lock. You now have the key. But you cannot use it there. Not yet. Your path leads elsewhere. You must make all haste to Absalom Station. Your destiny, and the next layer of the universe you seek to peel back, awaits you in the great city. Go. Now."  
Lowda snaps awake, his heart pounding. The ship is en route to theFarabarrium, but his course is now set for the heart of the Pact Worlds. At 25 years old, battered, awed, and filled with a terrifying sense of purpose, Lowda Medina is ready for the adventure that will truly define him.  
310 AG (Age 25) - The Second Scream & The Echo  
Three Days Out from the Phantom Rift  
The Event Horizon drifts through the calm, familiar void of the Diaspora's outer reaches. The crew is subdued, most still recovering from the psychic assault. Lowda spends his shifts in the medical bay, helping where he can, or in his small bunk, meditating with Pulse #423 to steady his mind. The Traveler's vision to go to Absalom Station burns in his thoughts, a divine imperative he is eager to follow as soon as they reach the Farabarrium.  
He is in the mess hall, alone, sipping a tasteless nutrient broth, when it hits.  
There is no physical force this time. No scream that pounds against the skull. Instead, reality itself seems to scream.  
The metal bulkhead beside him becomes so achingly real that its seams become razor-edged lines slicing into his vision. The curve of his drinking bulb feels like a bruise pressed directly against his consciousness. Every sound—the hum of the engines, the distant clang of a hatch—is a spike of crystalline clarity. For a terrifying moment, Lowda is drowning in the hyper-real, his senses overwhelmed by a universe that has suddenly become too sharp, too dense, too much to bear.  
Then, as abruptly as it intensified, the world snaps back. Not to normal. But to something close enough to normal that he can function. He gasps, clutching the table, his whole body trembling.  
And that's when he sees them.  
The mess hall is no longer empty.  
Faint, translucent blobs of motion drift through the space. They're formless at first, like heat shimmer given color. But as his newly-adjusted eyes focus, they resolve. Shapes become forms. Forms become faces.   Sarcesian. Ysoki. Human. Vesk. Species he doesn't recognize. Some smile serenely, lost in a memory. Most wear expressions of anguish, shock, or fury—faces frozen at the moment of some profound trauma.  
Ghosts.  
Lowda's breath catches. These aren't the psychic residues Pulse sometimes helps him perceive. These are something more. Something present.  
One of them—a grizzled Human male in what looks like pre-Gap mining attire—slowly turns its head. Its anguish-twisted face locks onto Lowda. It sees him. It notices him noticing.  
For a frozen moment, the ghost and the young sarcesian regard each other across an uncrossable gulf.  
Then it moves.  
It doesn't walk or drift. It lunges, crossing the space between them in a breath. The others follow, a silent, terrible tide of forgotten souls, their faces contorting with desperate need—  
And then, blackness.  
  
When Lowda awakens, he is lying on the cold deck of the mess hall. His head throbs. Pulse #423 orbits him slowly, its light dim and worried.  
A figure hovers nearby, looking down at him.  
It's vaguely Sarcesian in outline, but the details slide away whenever Lowda tries to focus on any one point. The harder he looks, the more they pull apart, like trying to hold smoke. It tilts its head in a gesture that radiates gentle curiosity, even kindness.  
When it speaks, the voice is the tail end of a fading echo, as if the words have traveled a very long distance to reach him.  
"And when are you from?"  
Lowda blinks, his mind struggling to process the question. "I... what?"  
The Echo—for that is what it must be, one of the drifting souls, but different, calmer, more aware—tilts its head the other way.  
"A simple question. You see us. You fell when we reached for you. So I ask: when are you from? What moment births a soul that can perceive the lost?"  
"I'm from... now. 310 AG. After the Gap."  
The Echo seems to consider this. "After. So far after. Then you are not one of us. You are simply... open. A door left ajar." It gestures vaguely at the empty mess hall. "They will keep coming. They are lost, confused, in pain. They will reach for you because you are the only light they have seen in so very long."  
Lowda swallows, his Witchwarper instincts screaming that this being is right. He can still feel them, at the very edges of his perception—the faint, diffuse blobs, waiting.  
"Who... what are you?"  
The Echo's smile is a sad, flickering thing. "I am what they could have been, had they found peace. I am the memory of a moment, given lingering shape. The Echo of Lost Moments, some call me. I have watched them for so long. I have tried to guide them. But they cannot hear me. They can, however, hear you." It leans closer, and for a moment, Lowda glimpses a face of profound age and profound sorrow. "Let me help you help them. Bind with me, little door. I will teach you to see them clearly, to understand their pain, to guide them onward. And in return, you will never be alone in the dark. There will always be a voice, even if it is only an echo."  
Pulse #423 hums, a sound of assessment, then of acceptance. The Traveler's fragment finds no treachery here, only purpose.  
Lowda, his heart pounding, nods.  
The Echo reaches out a translucent hand and touches his chest. There is no physical sensation, but Lowda feels something click into place, like a lock tumbling open. Suddenly, the diffuse blobs in the corners of his vision snap into sharp, heartbreaking clarity. He can see them all—an Ysoki child clutching a broken toy, a Vesk warrior with a wound through his chest, a Lashunta woman weeping silently. And he can feel them, their confusion, their fear, their desperate loneliness.  
He is now bound to the Echo of Lost Moments. He is an Animist.  
  
Later That Day  
Lowda sits in his bunk, staring at his hands. Pulse #423 orbits calmly. The Echo is a quiet presence at the edge of his thoughts, not intrusive, but there. He can feel the ghosts on the ship, too, but they are distant now, watchful. The Echo has explained that they will come to him when they are ready, and he will learn, in time, to help them.  
He has sold his few large possessions—his father's old cartography tools (he has newer, better ones now), his collection of physical star charts, the extra environmental suit he'd been saving "just in case." The credits sit in his account, enough for a one-way ticket to Absalom Station on the next freighter willing to take a passenger.  
He sends a flurry of messages:  
To his parents: "I'm safe. Something happened. Something amazing and terrifying. I'm going to Absalom Station. The Traveler has shown me the way. I'll explain more when I can. I love you both. Don't worry."  
To Chik: "You won't BELIEVE the week I've had. Ghosts, Chik. Actual ghosts. And one of them is my friend now. Heading to the Station. Meet me there if you can? Drinks are on me. I have SO much to tell you."  
To Dr. Vex, with a formal request to be released from the expedition: "My deepest apologies, Doctor. My experiences in the Rift have... fundamentally altered my path. I must follow a new calling. I wish you and your future endeavors every success. The Enigma will wait for another day."  
As the Event Horizon finally docks at the Farabarrium, Lowda Medina gathers his small bag, checks that Pulse is secure, and acknowledges the Echo's quiet presence. He is 25 years old. He is a Witchwarper, a Witch, and now an Animist bound to an Echo of Lost Moments. He has seen the dead, spoken with a fragment of a god, and heard the scream of a sentient planet.  
And he is on his way to Absalom Station.  
The universe, he is learning, is far stranger and far more vast than even he ever imagined. And he cannot wait to explore every terrifying, beautiful inch of it.  
  
  
  
Beyond the first level.  
Question: Are you higher than level 1? What level?  
Answer:  
Question: What year did your character achieve first level in their class?  
Answer:  
Question: How long has it been chronological since your character was first level?  
Answer:  
Question: What has your character been doing since they started adventuring (aka first level)?  
Answer:  
Question: How did you achieve each level? Aka what did you kill to level up?  
Answer:  
Question: How long did each level take to achieve?  
Answer:  
Time since level 1.  
This is a continuation of the 'Backstory by each year' section for if you are starting after the first level. This section involves writing what your character has been doing since level 1, aka since their backstory.  
To do this, you can decide at what age the character became level 1, and what age they are now. Example: Level 1 at age 20, level 10 at age 25. This example would put the character at a progression rate of 6 months to 1 level. For a human this is pretty normal, but for an elf you may space levels out over decades, longer for some other races.  
Assuming level 1 at age 20, that means they came level 1 in 4705 AR. Now we expand out your 'backstory by each year' section but including 'level x' after the age of our character before the colon.
Example = 4705 AR, age 20, level 2: Killed my first human and drunk their blood, sanity is starting to leave me...
