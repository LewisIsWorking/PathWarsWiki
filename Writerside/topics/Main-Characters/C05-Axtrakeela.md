# C05-Axtrakeela

> Backstory. 
>> - Axtrakeela (Axtra for short), named after her parents, lived a relatively sheltered life in the jungles near Garund during the first eight or so years of her life.
>> - Her father and mother provided her with a safe and nurturing environment that was a stark contrast to her life in "Medina Mudaii`a". 
>> - Shortly after her eighth birthday, while playing in the trees with a couple of her siblings, a blazing portal to the Plane of Fire opened and snatched her from her home.
>> - The process had changed her and miraculously altered her physiology to allow her to survive. 
>> - In Medina Mudaii`a: it did not take long for Axtra to become a slave to an Ifrit named Aziz.
>> - It would take her years to realise that having Aziz as a master was a blessing, though it would be one she would never wish on another.
>> - Aziz was prideful among all things, and he accepted nothing less than worship from his living property.
>> - So long as you gave him the service and praise he expected, he would take good care of you.
>> - Of course, it would be the sort of care you would give your prized horse, but it was better than the tortures he could have easily produced. 
>> - Axtra was able to make a friend, an Azer named Ember light.
>> - Ember light's skin was a fascinating shade of bronze.
>> - It glistened in almost a mirror-like fashion, making the flames of the world around them dance along the structures.
>> - Every day, after her tasks had been completed, Axtra would seek out Ember light, and they would talk throughout all the remaining hours of the day, so much so that they would often fall asleep in mid-conversation.
>> - It would not be incorrect to consider Ember light to be Axtra's first love. 
>> - As Axtra grew older, she started learning that she could manipulate the surrounding flames around her.
>> - It was not impressive at first, but nonetheless, Ember light told her never to show anyone, especially Aziz.
>> - At night, she often caught herself intentionally creating small flames near Ember light to watch it dance off her skin.  
>> - This was a mistake she would eventually pay dearly for.
>> - On that day, Axtra let her guard down and made the flame dance, only to be seen by a guest of Aziz.  
>> - The display impressed the guests, and they praised Axtra for having such fine control over the flames.  
>> - Since Aziz was unaware, he felt like a fool.  
>> - His pride would not let that be, and after the honoured guest had left, he began to mercilessly beat Axtra with his whip.  
>> - He cursed at her with each snap.  
>> - And when Axtra thought she was about to meet her end, Ember light drove a knife into Aziz's thigh.  
>> - It was a non-fatal wound, much more than what could be said of the strike he swung at Ember light.  
>> - Axtra witnessed her fly across the room into the wall, blood splattering from the force.
>> - The next thing she knew, Axtra was back in the material plane, shaking in the cold next to the embers of what she could only assume used to be trees in the mountains.  
>> - A cat, made of flames, was nestled in her lap.  
>> - She never did find out how she made it back, and it took her many weeks of grief before she would find the determination to move forward.  
>> - She has too many questions and not enough answers.
>> - This would mark the beginning of her search.  
>> - Her adventures.
