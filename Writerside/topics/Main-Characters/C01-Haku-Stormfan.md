The clan is called Arashi no Hane (Translates to Feather of Storm.) There, the Tengu managed to settle on a previously uninhabited Island. They have mostly kept their tradition of performing ritual dances and adhering to Hei Feng which allowed them to summon storms to protect their Island. In the years and generations following the Clan has found a few artefacts on the Island which they want to protect. Over the course of generations, these Tengu have grown wings that allows them to nagivate the plane easier. They have learned to weave the ability of flight more and more into their dances, making them dangerous and agile warriors. Only a few Tengu born can control the air to their whim, while clerics of Hei Feng can only enact a limited control. The clan used to keep to themselves, they have opened up more to contact other inhabitants of the plane of air, participating in trade and exchange.
