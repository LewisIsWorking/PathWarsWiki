Running with a gang of orphan back in Nantambu, Ji Ho became adapt at stealing magic items and using them to help his fellow orphans out. Eventually he was picked up by Sisko, a bandit chief who lead the Sisko's Marauders. Taking him under his wing, Ji Ho was taught how to be a proper thief and scoundrel by Sisko. Though after a few years running with the marauders help Ji Ho develop, it was clear to him that he wouldn't want to stay a bandit, so with the help of Sisko, he joined a friendly mercenary group the Screaming Eagles. There he started out as a runner boy, delivering messages, though it wasn't long before he managed to land himself a position as a squire to one of the mercenaries. He learned how to position himself and his teammates from the mercenaries. Time passed, Ji Ho found himself helping out with the logistics of the Screaming Eagles more than being on the front lines but one day he received a letter. Sisko had been murdered and the only clue to the murder was a coin that was left on the body which had both sides scratched out. Ji Ho left the Screaming Eagles a week later, deciding to become an adventurer in hope of finding more clues about the killer somehow. He got tangled with people from all over the Mwangi Expanse, explored just as much of the expanse as he searched far an wide for any clue, even had a passionate romance at one point. However, he never did find anymore clues to who had killed his old master and to this day remains a sore spot for him.
