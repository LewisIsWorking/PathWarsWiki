Question: Finally, what is your character's backstory?
Answer: Lee Ji Ho was born to loving parents in the city of Nantambu. They were travelling merchants from Hwanggott and sought to lay roots down in a city of magic in hopes their child would get into the vaunted university in Nantambu. Their dream was cut short however, during a caravan trip to trade with neighbouring town, their merchant troupe came under attack of a Kholo tribe. Ji Ho's parents did not survive the attack, leaving him fend for himself. He was forced onto the streets before his parents corpses were cold, the family life saving held "entrust" for him until he came of age by the merchant guild that brutally flung Ji Ho into a life of poverty. His first few nights on the cold streets would have seen him dead if it weren't for the intervention of a gang of misfits. These wild children took pity on Ji Ho and brought him into their little family of orphaned children. They taught him how to steal magical items, taught him how to trick the items into working for the kids. Ji Ho found that he had a knack when it came to tricking the magical devices and soon found his place among the wild kids of Nantambu. When he was ten years old, Ji Ho found himself in a spot of trouble. He had been out thieving in the market place when he was caught. It wasn't a guard that had picked up the wayward child but a fellow scoundrel. The man saw in Ji Ho talent for his roguish ways, so instead of beating the little thief, Sisko took Ji Ho to his band of bandits outside the city. 
	Ji Ho was reluctant to follow the mysterious bandit leader at first, but when he came to understand that this was an opportunity to learn how to really become a professional thief, Ji Ho took to the lesion like a fish in water. After some time, Ji Ho became a runner boy between the wild children of Nantambu and the bandit group Sisko ran, arranging all sorts of jobs for both groups and running rough shot over the nobility's coffers. He even manage to rob the Merchant guild that he parents used to belong too, taking his heritage along with payment of years being on the street because of them. By the time he was sixteen, Ji Ho had become the picture of a rogue and following well in Sisko's footstep. But the old man had a surprise for Ji Ho, handing him a formal invitation into a mercenary group called the Screaming Eagles. He wished for Ji Ho to have a life outside of crime, coming to care for the boy like his own son and though the university was out of his reach  he still managed to grab an opportunity for Ji Ho to become something more then just a rogue. Ji Ho took the invitation, saying farewell to the city that had raised him and the unscrupulous family that had taken care of him until now. Travelling to Bloodcove, he met with the Screaming Eagles. 
	There was no grand ceremony or welcome waiting for Ji Ho, he had been invited to work for the Eagles and they expected him to get with the program quickly. Ji Ho struggled in the early days, long marches in heavy armor and fighting that would test someone strength. If days had continued like this, it would be safe to say Ji Ho wouldn't have lasted in the Screaming Eagles. It was only until his skills with his hands and book smarts were found out by the commanding structure that he was pulled out of the grunt work and set to work on tasks that he could really excel at. Caring for magical items, keeping books, managing the movement of troops, and learning to fence from the duellists of the Screaming Eagle. When introduced with these task, Ji Ho began to shin in the eyes of the management. He was taught in the ways of logistical command, making sure people moved and supplies found their way on time to the correct positions. He had learned how to use a cane sword from Sisko, but here he found out how to really apply the philosophy of two weapon fighting and how to make the most of his light armor which he had a greater affinity with compared to the heavy armor he was expected to wear when he was just another grunt for the company. By eighteen, Lee Ji Ho had been given a position in the logistical wing of the Screaming Eagles. He got enganged with a older mercenary, Sinkitah Zallahani but their love was never allowed to mature as she died on a job. In his grief, Ji Ho was passed a letter. Sisko had also died. Murdered, with the only clue being found being a coin with both sides of the coin scratched out. Grief turned to despair, despair turned to out rage, and rage became action. Lee Ji Ho vowed complete vengeance on those who had taken his loved once from him. 
	With the help of the Screaming Eagles, he tracked down the rival mercenary group that had killed Sinkitah , the Zegnaga Raiders. There was a pitched battle where at any moment it could have spelled out the death of either the Raiders or the Eagles. During the scuffle and the confusion, Ji Ho broke through the lines and assassinated the leader of the Bandit, turning the tide of battle for the Screaming Eagles. It lead to the eradication of the Zegnaga Raiders with only pockets of the mercenaries being able to flee from the battlefield. After the fight, Ji Ho applied for the experimental position of "Outrider" for the Screaming Eagles. This would effectively make him an adventurer sponsored by the Screaming Eagles and allow him the freedom to investigate the death of his mentor and adoptive father Sisko. A few months later, in recognition of Ji Ho skills and his action of killing the Zegnage Raider's leader, he was awarded with the title of Outrider. Given gold and supplies, the Screaming Eagles let Ji Ho go into the world as a free agent with the same fanfare as he came into the Screaming Eagles, but this time with a pat on the shoulder from his fencing teacher. Ji Ho returned to Nantambu, levying all of his contacts in the city to find any thing that could be related to Sisko's murder. It took him half a year but eventually he found out about a death cult known as the two faced court, followers of a two faced God. Their symbol? A coin with both of the faces scratched out. For next six years of his life, Ji Ho travelled the world. Hiring adventurers whenever he found one of their safe houses or cult sites to obliterate it. He travelled from the Mwangi Expanse to Taldor, from Taldor to Cheliax, even to the distant shores of Tian Xia. He would systematically destroy the Court wherever he found them. It was only until he personally killed the Pope of the Court, the glue that held the faith together, did Ji Ho stop hunting them down. All known traces of the court had been extinguished and their brightest star had been cut down by Ji Ho personally. At the age of 25 year old, Lee Ji Ho found himself free for the first time. He had avenged his personal grudges, he had upheld the honour of the Screaming Eagles, and he had honed his skills as a agent of retribution to a razor's edge. He thought to himself for a long time before deciding on a course of action. He would continue his life as an adventurer, travel with his long term friend Mizzik and find out what the world had in store for him.
