Born on a ship travelling through the Drift, Miyuu's destiny was almost predetermined by the brilliant colors of his fur. 
"Blessed by Triune" many would claim, but that didn't matter to Miyuu, since the rest of his litter were lifeless. 
His parents were crewmen for hire, and never really talked about that grisly fact of his birth. 
They took whatever jobs they could get their paws on in exchange for room and board. 
Miyuu, being a Prismeni, was considered good luck on a starship and often helped them secure those jobs. 
As Miyuu grew older, he took great interest in the inner workings of the starships he traveled on and their systems. 
He started to get good at understanding how they worked and would often find himself in the cockpit, flight deck, or whatever else the ship may call it. 
He would watch in amazement at the work it took to control these vessels. 
Eventually, around his 11th birthday, his parents secured a permanent position on the starship Interstellar Claw. 
Here, he met the great captain Divah Flynn, an Android. 
She was the best pilot that Miyuu had ever seen. He may have been biased, as Divah often let him sit on her lap and question everything she did. 
She loved teaching him all the controls and navigation systems. 
He also learned to shoot under her watch, though his parents disapproved. 
She explained everything to him and quickly became his mentor. 
By the time Miyuu became an adult, he could already pilot the ship on his own.
Divah even claimed him as her 2nd in command, even if it wasn't official. 
One day, the Interstellar Claw received a distress call from a ship called the S.V. Discovery, and Divah diverted course to aid.  
Arriving on the scene, everything immediately felt off to Miyuu. 
His fur was standing on end, and he felt his heart pounding hard enough to echo in his ears. 
Nobody answered Divah's calls for information, and eventually, she decided they would need to board and investigate. 
Miyuu was in charge while she was away, though he begged her and the others to leave it be. 
It would only be him and two others left on the ship when things went wrong. 
Divah radioed in with sounds of screaming in the background, demanding that Miyuu leave and get help. 
He argued, of course, but she promised everything would be fine, but they needed help. 
That would be the last time he heard from Divah or his parents. 
When he returned with help, the S.V. Discovery was gone, with no trace to follow.
Miyuu has since taken up work where he can, trying to find clues as to what happened to that ship.
