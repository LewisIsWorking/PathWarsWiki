Joo-Dee was born in the city of Maro on Akiton. She doesn't really remember her parents; a fire from an explosion took their lives and left her body badly scarred at the age of 7. 
In the orphanage, she isolated herself from the other children, hating the attention her injuries gave her. 
The Matron of the house, a Kasatha named Maeda, often encouraged her to play with the others, saying things like, "The universe is vast and lonely enough as it is without you trying to make it lonelier" or "You'll never find anything if you do not seek it out." 
She was kind, but Joo-Dee never cared to listen to her. 
The pain from her burns still lingered. 
Maeda did, however, introduce Joo-Dee to Weydan's teachings. 
And although it would take her many years to embrace them fully, some of her fondest memories were of her and Maeda reading stories of seeking new worlds and wonders. 
Unfortunately, the orphanage would be caught in the middle of a turf war between two gangs, with Matron Maeda giving her life to save seven children who were trapped inside the crumbling building, Joo-Dee included. 
Clutching the book she was reading with Maeda, Joo-Dee promised herself she would never lose anyone else close to her heart. 
Now 14, she began taking up work wherever she could find it and eventually ended up on Aballon three years later. 
She primarily worked for doctors or priests, learning how to mend wounds and to treat ailments. 
One day, she ended up working for a robot named Tier-99 Professor. He was a fascinating machine, far friendlier than one would assume. 
When he noticed Joo-Dee's painful scars from her burns, he assisted in funding some augmentations. 
At first, Joo-Dee was unsure about the process of replacing her "dermis with non-organic material" (a direct quote from the Professor himself). 
But soon after, those insecurities disappeared. 
Not only was her pain gone, but she felt empowered by the hardened skin. 
Her mood shifted drastically, and she found herself taking on more augmentations as her life went on. 
She worked for The Professor for only a year before beginning her journey through the stars, but it was a year she cherished, as it marked a key turning point in her life. 
Then, one day, about five years after she departed from Aballon, she received a message from the Professor and a rendezvous point for her transfer onto "The Nova Rush."
