Fighter/Wizard.
The find peace through meditating on the sin of their heritage and of their study - Wrath. 
They "meditate" on this through combat and battle, and rigorous training to direct their rage and wrath at necessary targets.
By being cast out from the plane of demons (I forget names) and becoming a renegade demon, vowing to use their anger and rage at this to better society, thus searching for a way to channel that rage, arriving on the school of cypher mages.
The school of cypher mages would've instructed them in their wizard tutoring, and they would be self taught as a fighter

Body

See character art for their human form, which is what they will be in basically all the time. Their demon form would have yellower skin, very small winglets, and blunted, shaved down horns, but otherwise be very similar
Female
Roughly 6" - 6"1'
I do not know body weight well enough to say an amount, but they will be stocky and well-built, mostly muscle
Pale skin.
Bright blue eyes.
Brown hair.
Very long hair, braided to keep it out of their face.
It would be noticed that they hold themselves with unusual stiffness, not unnaturally/uncomfortably so, but in a disciplined way that is enough to be noticed.

They tend to speak fairly bluntly, without much in the way of descriptors or embellishment, in a very calm tone.

They fight using a naginata, and are very attached to their weapon as it is the source of their cypher mage power, containing their rune of sin

Naginata for reference
