>> - Name meaning: she of gold, representing her family's hopes for her, last of the "Denure" line. 
>> - born: 4498 8 Sarenith. 
>> - class: wizard. 
>> - opinions of class: even after all these hundreds of years, she still admires the wondrous splendour of magic, though recently she has become more utilitarian in its use.

>> - she came into her talent in magic at a young age after finding an abandoned scroll of prestidigitation. 
>> - In less than a month, she managed to reverse-engineer it to the basic mechanics of magic.

>> - Class 2: fighter.

> Opinions of class: she will find it a valuable tool, and may grow in time to love the thrill of combat as she does the splendour of magic
> Race: elf
> Subrace: ancient
> Have they met others of their race?: she was raised by her biological family and lives in a kingdom with a significant elf population
does your character like your race: she has the same opinions on her race, most people do, but she doesn't think 
> about it much, though she has grown to distrust people in general recently
where was she born and raised: Mwangi Expanse.
> Parents and family: she was the oldest child of a pair of well-known merchants, 
she doted on her younger brother dearly and loved her parents, 
however, they mysteriously vanished along with their family home and all memory of them one day.

>> - Parents' names: she lost the memories of their names and faces when they disappeared. Though she did manage to remember their existence. 
>> - are they alive: no, they are so not alive, they were never alive parents' professions: merchants of great repute.
>> - Any other family: a little brother who she doted on until he disappeared with her parents.
>> - sexuality: demisexual pan-romantic, though she would not be able to tell you this because she has never even thought 
about romance in her life because she is history's most deeply repressed nerd. 
>> - marital status: single
>> - kids: no
>> - want kids: she is conflicted, on the one hand, they remind her of her little brother, on the other hand, they 
remind her of her little brother.
>> - Is she in love? No, not currently.
>> - Has she been in love? Not yet.
>> - alignment: bordering between neutral and chaotic good
>> - moral code: deliver only what others would deliver unto me, protection of the innocent.
>> - goals: find out what happened to her family, stop the apocalypse that she keeps having dreams about.
>> - follow a god: she has studied gods fiercely, and finds them too human to be worthy of worship, she admires many of them for their deeds and power, but she does not worship.
>> - personal beliefs: everything that happens was always fated to happen, at the root of magic lies the ability to break that line of causality.
>> - personality quirks: tends to ramble a lot when conversation broaches a subject she is knowledgeable in, otherwise quite quiet and subdued, almost mournful.
>> - antisocial: does not dislike the company of others, but is a bit awkward.
>> - arrogant: at times she tends to become overconfident in her magic.
>> - optimistic: no, she is about as pessimistic as it is possible to be, she has suspected that the end of the 
     > world is coming for about 50 years.
>> - paranoid: exceptionally so, she knows that there is some force out there with a reason to target her family and the ability to manipulate memories on a national scale.
>> - why does she adventure: to find out what happened to her parents and save the world.
>> - how does she view her role as an adventurer: a protector first and foremost.
>> - get along with others: her awkwardness and lack of experience make her a bit stiff and cold at first, but she rarely causes trouble with others.
>> - The things the character hates: followers of Groetus, talking about her past or her family.

>> - gender: female (cis: has never thought about gender before, might be non-binary if forced to think about it)
>> - height: 5'4
>> - weight: 45 kg
>> - skin colour: slightly tanned in the face, though when she takes off her cloak, the rest of her skin is notably 
     > paler.
>> - eye colour: a deep purple almost dark enough to be mistaken for black.
>> - hair colour: black, an experiment with transmutation in her youth, tinted the ends pink, but she keeps the ends hidden in her hood most of the time.
>> - hair length: slightly below shoulder-length, tied into a bun and stuffed into her hood most of the time.
>> - physique: she is lithe and has more recently built up fairly impressive musculature from training with her bow, she tends to wear loose leather armour and a cloak, so not much can be determined about her figure, though the way it falls does suggest quite wide hips.
>> - additional attributes: her eyes glow very slightly, which becomes noticeable in the dark.
>> - how does she speak: slow and stilted, almost awkward, unless the topic is one in which she is knowledgeable, at which point she becomes verbose and animated.
>> - mannerisms: similar to speech, does not tend to emote much unless rambling.
>> - distinguishing marks: no
>> - birthmarks: one on the small of her back
>> - scars: no
>> - deformities: no
>> - attractive: she is mildly above average
>> - breast size: completely average, perhaps slightly smaller
>> - what weapon does she use: a composite longbow that she crafted herself and filled with a variety of runes, 
she is self-taught in its usage, which means that despite her experience, her technique is not amazing
(will change when she takes the sword)
>> - armour: she wears a pair of runic bracers of defence that she crafted herself and a cloak that she uses to go 
     > around relatively unnoticed.
>> - does she like magic: see class
>> - Is she magical? her body is a testament to mildly nonsensical experimentation, however, it is not immediately noticeable.
>> - spells: this feels kind of redundant with the class section, she can cast sixth-level spells.
>> - equipment: Aurelia does not tend to carry a lot around with her, but she does have a bag of holding.
>> - alignment scale: 10 3
>> - Instead of background by each year, I am going to summarise.
She is 212 years old and I very much do not want to write all that.
Discovered magic at an early age, and was fascinated by it.
She continued to study it as she grew, entering Magaambya 
initially as a student and graduating to become a researcher there. 
Then left to pursue her goals after her family disappeared from history. 
She Has since spent the time becoming more utilitarian as opposed to her previous academic focus.
Learning about the dangers of the world as she hones her practical skills.

- What does your character look like?
	1. A tall gnarled vaguely humanoid body, with a torso that expands up from the waist like a cone instead of a triangle.
	2. The head is immobile with gemstones for the eyes.
	3. The torso is covered in multiple layers of metal cords,
	4. but two spots reveal a smooth black surface beneath, with blue markings that look like drawn-on eyes.
	5. The cords extend down their arms, ending several inches above the wrist.
	6. Below that is a fabric that hangs almost down to their knees.

**Backstory.**

- Carnon the Magus Gunslinger, the Corrector Conrasus began in a small druidic grove; the grove begged the skies for
  protection.
- PROTECT THEM FROM WHAT?
- Carnon's Aeon sent them to the druids.
- During their time in the grove they grew their Magus powers with great success.
- Upon completing his training, Gallrock the Arch Druid of the grove grew from the earth a band of force.
- During their years, they became curious about the stories they heard of explosions harnessed inside metal.
- This was not knowledge the druids had.
- Eventually, as the Grove prospered and grew, his services were deemed redundant.
- The deciding factor was a manticore attack, a manticore that was beaten before Carnon was able to make it to the scene.
- Carnon took a trophy from the manticore's corpse as a reminder to keep growing.
- They decided the best way to serve their Aeon was to research further into the story of these explosions.
- His research led him to a coastal city, where they, through much persuasion, managed to land an apprenticeship
  with a gunsmith named Belron.
- They learned the craft with much fervour, applying much of their Magus weapons training, and teachings the Druids gave them.
- They were able to create a powerful firearm that utilised the Manticore trophy.
- During an excursion into a different city to peddle the wares their Mentor Belron the Gunsmith had crafted, Belron
  The gunsmith was attacked inside his store.
- Upon returning to their Store, Carnon found it burnt down, and his mentor Belron the Gunsmith was slain.
- With their great skill in Smithing, Gunnery, and the arcane Arts, Carnon was recruited into the city's Guard.
- This served Carnon, as they mentored under the city Investigator: Opus The Investigator.
- Opus The Investigator helped him pursue leads to what happened to their Mentor Belron the Gunsmith's store.
- Eventually, the case had grown cold, but Carnon stayed on with the guards for several more years.
- During one investigation, the clues lead to Carnon being the perpetrator of several murders.
- Not being able to clear their name, Carnon fled on a ship, leaving the town.
- They spent some months on this ship where they learned from an esoteric man the secrets that certain crystals
  possess, this is how Carnon learned crystal healing.
- The ship eventually made port in a town/place where the character will be introduced to the party.

**Plot threads.**

- Why does your character adventure?\
  They are currently on the run from a city guard, but they also want to collect knowledge for their Aeon.

- Ideas:
	1. Create/find the world's greatest firearm.
	2. What are your thoughts on civilisation/forms of civilisation?
	   Not biased.
	   Druidic way of life is self-sufficient.
	   The groves are well protected, but they are too isolationist.
	3. Civic Guard Druid.
	4. Interest in Irespan? Living stone = Living wood, create a city-living golem.
	5. Can hear crystals talking/connected to other crystals.
	6. Hell knight of the mask?
	7. Maybe the grove was in Numeria, the same grove as Allisee's armour was from.
	8. Met Dr Boojuu on the boat to Riddleport.

- Plot Threads.
	1. Hell knights coming after Carnon.
	2. Figuring out what the non-city whispers are.
	3. Who killed Belron the Gunsmith / burned down the store?
	4. Why did Queen Cressida Croft reinstate the bounty?
	5. Obtaining high-tech equipment: weapons, armour, etc.
	6. Helping Numerian druids weave together greater high-tech equipment with their primal magic.
	7. Make Numeria safe/great again. Reduce the threat to the local populace (druids and the town of Torch).
	8. Why is Carnon pulled so strongly towards the shards of sin/aeon stones?
	9. Who is the Aeon?

>> - Ronove (when used by his Necromancer). 
>> - Lire (current “heroic” alter ego).
>> - Class: Summoner (Devil = Zander)/Bard, Level 11.

> The Hell knight and His Beloved.
>> - Born into the rigid and Machiavellian nobility of Caliphes, Evonor Essora embodied their discipline and ambition. 
>> - His life was predestined as a Hell knight of the Gate. 
>> - Trained in the doctrines of Asmodean law and infernal contracts, he became a beacon of order amidst Ustalav's ever-present corruption. 
>> - Despite his rigid exterior, he harboured a passionate soul of which yearned for something more than duty and order—he yearned for love. 
>> - That love came in the form of Lady Anamerie Calavastus, the daughter of a rival noble family deeply entrenched in Pharasma's faithful. 
>> - Their connection was instantaneous and intense, a forbidden spark that defied the oppressive strictures of their lives. 
>> - Nonetheless, they pursued each other in secret. 
>> - Each knew the price of their love but believed they could rewrite their fate.

> The Betrayal and Tragedy of Evonor.
>> - His devilish patron, Evonor, long yearned for a tragic conclusion to this dalliance. 
>> - Rushing their end of a bargain, Evonor's body, the devil orchestrated an exposé through letters and whispers. 
>> - When Anamerie's family uncovered the affair, her older brother, Lord Zander, demanded a deathly duel, accusing Evonor of tainting his house. 
>> - Though a skilled warrior, Evonor required Zander's aid, ultimately falling to Zander's righteous fury. 
>> - He died in her arms, disappointing his family a final time. 
>> - Stricken with grief and despair, Anamerie ended her own life that same night, a dagger to her heart. 
>> - The scandal rippled through Ustalav, and their tale became a cautionary tragedy, immortalised as a day of mourning: the "Twilight of Two Houses".

> Undeath and Rediscovery
>> - Evonor's spirit yearned for something far greater than revenge: love. 
>> - Fractured in soul and frozen in time, both he and Zander remained but a comatose Revenant. 
>> - Decades later, the remains were unearthed by a necromancer of the Whispering Way, a twisted visionary collecting the corpses of Ustalav's historical figures to role-play violent theatrics. 
>> - Reanimated as a mindless revenant, Evonor-Zander served as a vessel of death, an unthinking husk. 
>> - Yet each soul it claimed, each fragment of divine essence consumed, gradually restored the shattered spirit. 
>> - Memories of the entire past flooded Zander, but only pieces reached Evonor. 
>> - What little he claimed felt like burning shame, the desperate cries of his mother—above all, the unyielding devotion he bore for Anamerie.  
>> - When Evonor fully gained consciousness, his first sensations were the whispers of Zander. 
>> - The sly and enigmatic fiend claimed to have stayed by his side even in undeath. 
>> - The devil offered comfort and direction, helping Evonor piece together the shards of his past while carefully omitting the truth of his betrayal. 
>> - Zander's motives, as always, were layered and opaque. 
>> - He deflected inquiries about missing memories, weaving half-truths about the events leading to his death and their shared fall from grace. 
>> - Yet he spoke of purpose, redemption and love in terms that Evonor—adrift and desperate—was willing to believe. 
>> - When his mind and heart fully reawakened, he abandoned his dark master and sought absolution. 
>> - Wandering across the Inner Sea, he searched tirelessly for Anamerie's soul, praying she had found peace. 
>> - His journey led him to Geb, where he uncovered astonishing truths…

> Anamerie's Tale 
>> - For decades, her soul lingered in the Grave-lands, unable to pass to Pharasma's judgment. 
>> - Her unyielding love for Evonor anchored her to the world, a tragic spectre yearning for closure. 
>> - Her cries did not go unheard; a man named Selenor, a wanderer steeped in sorrow and forbidden magics, sensed her anguish. 
>> - Compassionate yet troubled by his demons, Selenor resolved to give her the freedom she had been denied in life. 
>> - Drawing upon the sigils etched upon his soul, he restored Anamerie to undeath, allowing her to flee the cursed Grave lands.
>> - Anamerie found herself in Geb, where her presence caught the eye of a Blood Lord and daughter of Urgathoa. 
>> - This enigmatic figure, both patron and protector, helped Anamerie reinvent herself. 
>> - Under her guidance, Anamerie devoted her unlife to Naderi, the goddess of lost lovers and tragic endings, finding solace and purpose in comforting others who suffered from the pain of love.

> A Love Rekindled.
>> - When Evonor found Anamerie, the reunion was bittersweet. 
>> - Their circumstances vastly changed. 
>> - Anamerie had grown beyond her past tragedy, embracing her unlife as a chance to do good and serve Naderi's will. 
>> - Still, she could not deny her love for him and recognised that his journey of redemption mirrored her own. 
>> - But his arrival brought complications. 
>> - Newfound freedom from the Whispering Way's control made him a potential target for retribution by his former master, and his presence endangered Anamerie's carefully cultivated position in Geb. 
>> - Recognizing the danger, her patron intervened. 
>> - As Blood Lord, she offered Evonor protection under her banner, naming him her emissary. 
>> - He would represent her interests in the broader world in exchange for shelter and political immunity. 
>> - Anamerie sensed the danger Zander posed. Her new patron, the daughter of an Urgathoan Blood Lord, regarded the devil with suspicion. 
>> - However, she allowed him to stay, recognising the usefulness of his cunning in navigating Geb's deadly politics. 
>> - Ever the manipulator, Zander leaned into his role as Evonor's advisor, positioning himself as a facilitator of the Blood Lord's goals. 
>> - He presented the collection of blood as an extension of both Naderi's mission and Evonor's role as an emissary. 
>> - His words carried enough of the truth to persuade, even as his hidden schemes simmered beneath the surface. 
>> - Realizing he could not simply rekindle their love without understanding the man who had brought her back, Evonor resolved to meet Selenor. 
>> - Driven by the hope of reuniting with Anamerie as equals in their second lives, he swore an oath: to prove himself worthy of this new chance, to earn the love that time and tragedy had stolen, and to ensure other stories would not end in sorrow.

> The Revenant and His Legacy. 
>> - As Evonor Essora, now Lire, roams the lands in search of Selenor, the man who gave Anamerie her second chance, his path takes him through a bustling coastal port in Andoran. 
>> - There, amidst the cacophony of street vendors and the crashing of waves, he encounters a presence that stops him in his tracks. 
>> - Ellene, a young half-elf woman—bold and sharp-witted—moves through the crowd with a grace that seems achingly familiar. 
>> - When her eyes briefly meet his, "Lire" is struck by a pang of recognition. 
>> - Something in her gaze, a mischievous light and a spark of defiance, reminds him of Anamerie. 
>> - Unbeknownst to both Lire and Ellene, she is a distant descendant of their only child, born in secret and left behind after their tragic deaths.

> Personality and Motivations
>> - Evonor Essora is a complex figure. 
>> - Once a paragon of duty and law, his experiences have instilled a deep understanding of the fragility of love and the cruelty of fate. 
>> - Though he retains his martial prowess and the disciplined demeanour of a Hell knight, his heart now burns with empathy and compassion. 
>> - He strives to help others escape the chains of tragedy, often placing himself in danger to shield those who suffer.
>> - His quest to meet Selenor is not born of jealousy but curiosity and gratitude. 
>> - He sees the man as a kindred spirit—someone who defied mortality to create something beautiful from ruin. 
>> - Above all, Evonor seeks to craft a new legacy, one not of mourning and regret but of redemption and love.

> Potential Hooks
>> - Reuniting with Selenor: Evonor's journey to find Selenor might lead him into the heart of Geb's political intrigue, as Selenor's work could have drawn the attention of necromantic powers that view him as a rival.
>> - Champion of Naderi: Inspired by Anamerie's service to Naderi, Evonor seeks to prevent others from succumbing to despair. 
>> - Through actions and words, he offers solace and guidance to those devastated by the loss, hoping to give them the second chances he and Anamerie have found.
>> - Whispering Way Retribution: The necromancer who raised Evonor may seek to reclaim his prized revenant, dispatching undead assassins and arcane hunters to retrieve him. 
>> - Or they may target Ellene as leverage, forcing him to confront the cost of his past and present actions.
>> - A Love Worth Fighting For: Evonor's love for Anamerie is his driving force. 
>> - Though their second lives differ from their first, he cherishes the opportunity to court her anew, vowing to protect her and prove his worth.
>> - A Diplomat of Death: Evonor's training as a Hell knight has made him disciplined and articulate. 
>> - Now, he applies those skills to his role as the Blood Lord's emissary, leveraging his position to shield himself and Anamerie from the Whispering Way's vengeance.
>> - Defining the Bond: Evonor's protective instincts toward Ellene clash with her fiercely independent nature, creating tension as they navigate their shared quest and the complicated emotions of their connection.
>> - Anamerie's Knowledge: When Evonor eventually reunites with Anamerie, she may reveal that she always hoped their child's bloodline survived, adding another layer of poignancy to their reunion.
>> - Devoted Yet Haunted: Evonor's love for Anamerie and his desire to redeem his life's tragedy fuel his actions, but the shadow of his missing memories gnaws at him. 
>> - He is torn between trust in Zander and the growing realisation that the devil may not have his best interests at heart.
>> - Blood Rituals and Suspicion: While some view Evonor's blood collection as symbolic, others—particularly clerics of Pharasma—may see it as blasphemous or sinister. 
>> - His actions could draw the ire of divine agents or inquisitors.

> Plot hooks.

>> - Lire Wishes to Achieve Reuniting Fully with Anamerie.
>> - Getting Selenor's Blessing. 
>> - Lire yearns to solidify his second-life bond with Anamerie as equals and agents of Naderi's grace. 
>> - To do so, he seeks Selenor's blessing, believing that the man who gave her a second chance must approve of his worthiness in their new existence. 
>> - It is a profoundly personal milestone tied to his notions of honour, redemption and love. 
>> - 2: Uncovering the Truth of His Death and Missing Memories.
>> - The fog of his past weighs heavily on Lire. Zander's cryptic half-truths and evasions lead Lire to suspect that the devil knows far more than he admits. Fully uncovering the truth is both a haunting need and a terrifying prospect. 
>> - Was his demise orchestrated by forces greater than him? Was he complicit in his downfall in ways he does not yet understand?
>> - 3: Protecting Ellene and Preserving His Bloodline.
>> - The revelation of Ellene Verelli as his descendant ignites a new sense of purpose. 
>> - Though fiercely independent, Ellene's safety becomes paramount to "Lire". 
>> - Ensuring her survival—and her ability to choose her path—is an indirect way of redeeming his failure to protect his family. 
>> - 4: Becoming a Divine Servant of Naderi Serving as Naderi's champion and spreading her message of healing and acceptance to those broken by loss has become a cornerstone of Lire's journey. 
>> - He wants his second chance at existence to embody the goddess's ideals, transforming him into a beacon of hope amidst the tragedies of Golarion. 
>> - 5: Confronting the Whispering Way and Breaking Their Hold.
>> - "Lire" feels a profound responsibility to free himself—and others like him—from the Whispering Way's grip. 
>> - Though his actions are often personal and focused on love, he recognises that standing against this cabal of necromancers is a broader necessity for peace and justice.
>> - 6: Was given a wanted poster...

> Tying Lire to the Party. 
>> - 1: Blood Bond: Ellene's presence at the party creates immediate tension and depth. Her fierce independence clashes with Lire's protective instincts. 
>> - She resents any attempt at coddling or control, while Lire struggles to balance his desire to shield her with respect for her autonomy. 
>> - Their shared bloodline, once revealed, complicates their relationship further. 
>> - 2: Gratitude and Awe: Selenor is the one who restored Anamerie to undeath, giving her a second chance at existence.

> - Where shortly after his parents vanished, he spent the next 25 years before giving up and becoming an adventurer.
> - They decided to try out a few weapons and stuck with the rifle, and they hunted for the next few hundred years.
> - They never really gained praise as they were more of a background character by choice it was not until that fateful day.
> - When they saw Seraphine getting tossed around by a sea dragon.
> - I could not leave a child to that fate, so I shot the dragon, and since then they became inseparable for around 90 years before going missing.
> - Where I proceeded to drain and liquidate everything I had using every contact and calling in every favour, they were not going to let another loved one vanish into the ether. 
> - 40 years later, I found her, but her beautiful pine wings were missing.
> - There I found out they were stolen from her while mine only grew.

> - 3: Recover memories, find out why they were taken. 
> - 3: This may require Ascending to divinity despite Syver not wanting to be divine.
> - 4: Craft the ultimate weapon / major artefact weapon (gun). 
> - 4: First, create a level 20 monster weapon (requires level 20 & a LOT of monster slaying + harvesting).
