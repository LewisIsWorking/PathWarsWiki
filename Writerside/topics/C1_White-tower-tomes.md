### Introduction Note.

The following text can be found on a piece of paper that seems to have been slipped into your copy of the “Principia Arcana” when you picked up your replicas of the books.

“The following books are copies made by I, Bormgastor the draconic-wizard, defendor of the White Tower.

Each of these copies have been recreated down to the slightest of details.

I, Bormgastor, have also taken a frightfully long time to painstakingly experiment with each of the original copies to find all of their secret arcane notions then created copies of the notion that I deconstructed in base components before recreating in the copies of the books.

I have done this so that my copies will emulate the enchantments placed upon the originals by casters of far greater strength, resources, knowledge and skill than I.

If one cannot be original then they should do their best to copy,

and of course, what is the greatest compliment if not emulation?

-Bormgastor, dragon mage of the White Tower.”

## What you will find below…

Below I have created 12 sections that you can jump between using the table of contents found above.

Each section is an attempt to describe both what the book looks like and what the contents of each book is.

I have not tried to create a full book for each entry but rather an exerpt or a description to best describe what each book is about.

If you find anything below that seems incomplete, incorrect or anything please just let me know and I’ll fill it out, correct it, etc.

I am sorry this took so long.

# 1. Principia Arcana.

Below the title, this book has a stylised Sihedron upon its purple velvet cover.

The sihedron is more wavy than normal with less straight, defined lines and something more akin to wavy lines.

Each of these lines ends in strange symbols.

Normally the end of each point of the star would end in the rune assigned to each of the schools of Sin Magic.

Instead the symbols are different.

Instead of the sharp points and hard edges, these symbols have curves and oval shaping.

The small dashes and triagular shapes within the runes of sin have also been replaced with circles or dots.

It is unclear what this means.

On the right below you can see the new symbols, on the right you can see the symbols you are already familiar with on the typical Sihedron.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7215952e-4f6b-4020-b5b5-2e0a835534bf/Untitled.png)

The back of the book has a smooth velvet surface with no text or additional symbology.

As you run your hand across the smooth velvet surface you feel your hand become clean and less tense.

The book has clearly been magically enhanced to be better suited to long periods of extended reading.

Flipping open the cover reveals the first page of the Principia Arcana.

You notice that this page as with every other page in this book has a purple wavy line outlining the edge of the page.

Though this appears purely decorational this line seems to grow and shrink as you read each page.

With the line growing thinner as you reach the bottom of the page.

This seems to be some sort of reading aid, helping the reader to track where they left off.

From some experimentation, you are able to realise that if you skip or miss a section of the page then the line won’t go to its thinnest.

Additionally, the line on the index page seems to track your overall reading completion of the entire book.

“Fellow students of the Arcane.

This is the Principia Arcana.

If you are a follower of Lissala then some elements of this book are useful in mastering the channelling of the divine magic of our Goddess of fate.

The text may assist you with the usage of spells that make use of Wards and that make use of the mind, however, ultimately the study of the arcane is not a study of the divine and its power, for that you should retreat to the scrolls of your temples.

On the other hand, for the practitioners of the arcane, the wizards of Thassilon may gain insight and understanding into the most advanced, researched, prestigous and powerful of all magical traditions.

Within the following text, you will find a guide that aims to break the views on the mainstream metaphysical theorys of arcane magic.

…

The study of the arcane has progressed greatly since our Virtuous Emperor Xin took the backwards, racist and dim witted studies of the Azlanti and took it to the land of savages that now house our mighty empire.

…

The arcane helps us to gaze, probe and feel the multiverse around us.

Through this experimentation, we have been able to make many breakthroughs in magical research.

We have been able to organise the planes into discrete groups in relation to one another.

These groups lay within the two primary groups: the inner and outer spheres.

In the Inner Sphere, the Positive and Negative energy planes create and destroy life in opposition to one another.

The positive plane is the creation of souls.

The negative plane is the final destination of all magic that falls beyond the confines of the soul cycle.

The Material Planes that surround ours are generally smaller in size.

Our Material Plane of our reality spreads across an infinite realm.

Some scholars contest this point, instead poising the idea that our universe is expanding as time goes on.

Thes phenomenon has been viewed by Rune Binders however the Rune Guards have yet to confirm the Binder’s findings.

Later editions of this book may update this section of the research is ever finally confirmed.



The adjacent Elemental Planes provide the fundamental materials of the multiverse.

Additionally, the Ethereal Plane permeates the space in between the Material Planes.

The Astral Plane surrounds the Inner Sphere and connects it to the Outer Sphere planes, the destination of all mortal souls.

…

You will be aware that there are many professions that channel the Arcane.

The greatest of these, the Rune Casters, the wielders of Rune Magic are the greatest wielders of the Arcane, evolving it to a state in which feats carried out by these individuals have gone far and beyond the capabilities of the lesser professions.

The Rune Casters include Rune Binders, Archivists, Rune Knights, the Mighty Rune Guards and of course the most powerful of all: The Rune Lords.

The lesser casters of the Arcane include:

Arcanists, some bards, bloodragers, some clerics, magi, skalds, sorcerers, summoners, witches, and wizards.

Do not let these professions confuse you, while some of these mage’s professions may “use” the arcane, their limited understanding of the greater nature of the Arcane.

The secrets of the universe may be understood by one and one alone: the Wizard.

For it is the wizard profession from which our great Runelord rulers have risen before learning and mastering Rune Magic.

…

You will be aware of course that every spell has a base level to which it is assigned.

This numeric value determines the minimum amount of magical stamina that a magical user will need to be able to control and expend to successfully and correctly cast the spell.

While the strength of some spells can be impacted by the caster’s intelligence to some degree, it is not in fact the primary factor determining the spell casting capabilities of the individual.

Spellcasting is limited by the power of the soul.

The soul will primarily affect two things:

1. The maximum level of a spell of which an individual will be able to cast.
2. Partially the strength of the spell.

It was previously believed that the soul determined spellcasting stamina, more commonly referred to as spell slot count.

More recent research has found that it is the style of training and skill of the caster that determines spell slot count with casters of the same profession of similiar skill having a similar number of slots nearly always, with variations in spell slot count normally due to other variables such as special training.

It is nearly impossible to empower the soul without death.

More specifically the divine sparks that are shed from an individual’s soul upon their murder.

To the murderer/s go the spoil, with their souls being empowered from the bloodshed.

As a soul becomes more powerful however the soul requires the divine sparks of more and more powerful individuals.

…

How do arcane professions differ? And where does the magic of the arcane stem from?

In a previous chapter, we talked about spell slots, a precise measurement of the magical stamina required to cast a spell.

As this book is a fundamental primer to begin your understanding of the arcane I simplified the concept in that chapter.

A sufficiently strong spell slot, correct materials (if required) and the knowledge to cast the spell is not enough.

There is a base requirement known as a source.

This source must flow through the soul, formed by the verbal, empowered by the material and expelled with the somatic.

Arcane wielding professions tend to gather the source from divine sources or blood magic.

Some Gods lend their followers the ability to tap into the arcane by infusing their divine essence with the caster’s soul, supplying the energy required to expel arcane power.

The blood professions: blood ragers, arcanists and sorcerers all use the very blood in their veins to wield the arcane.

The latent magical potential in their blood is soul magic that has been infused in liquid form via planar radiation and then passed down genetically, this occurs whether the origin point is a parent of highly infused magical potential (their body is infused with the magic of their soul) has bred with the other parent, or if the parent has been blessed, cursed or exposed to this magic in a  concentrated dose either due to a magical item or planar exposure.

Wizards are not entirely different.

Part of our studious studying does require the knowledge to infuse our blood with the magics of our soul, however, this is a temporary effect lasting milliseconds during the casting of a spell, a flicker of infusion as opposed to a constant pool of energy to draw from.

Instead, the Wizard must apply their mind to the problem: the wizard needs a source.

Where do wizards pull from?
What is the source for a wizard?

The Astral Plane.

Also known as the Silver Sea.

A potentially infinite source of magic.

A God has limitations, blood has limitations, but the Astral Plane?
It is larger than any realm, it has more power than any God.

It is timeless, it is everlasting, and it is immeasurable.

The essence of the Astral Plane combines with a wizard’s soul evoking the Arcane.

…

For further studies of the arcane seek out the libraries within any of the seven domain’s capital cities:

Xin-Bakrakhan,

Xin-Cyrusian,

Xin-Edasseril,

Xin-Eurythnia,

Xin-Gastash,

Xin-Haruka

or Xin-Shalast.

If you have suffiencient clearance you will of course find the greatest tomes on the Arcane in the crystal libraries in the Imperial Capital City of Xin.”

The book ends here, the index implies that you have read all of the entire text.

# 2. The Apocrypha.

This brown book is slim, under a few hundred pages in length.

Flicking through the book causes a slight headache for no desernable reason.

Many pages of the book are blank, some pages are covered in endless scribes of ilegible text.

The title seems to have been written in ink mixed with blood and some sort of copper mixture, giving the two words a brown-reddish colouring, like dirty blood.

Despite its condition. something about this book gives off an impression that it is much, much newer than the older books in both the white tower and the sunken library.

“I write this collection of findings under a fake name.

I do not want my writings to cause my life to shatter and die as I believe the world might do.

Sin Magic is a purer, more focused form of arcane magic.

Focusing on the seven schools, aligning them to the sins and indulging results in considerably more powerful magics.

This has resulted in weakness, a lack of diviners, to see far both in space and in time.

Lissala is the Goddess of fate, the source of Divination within the empire.

Yet in recent times has no one found the recent pain of diviners strange?

The lack of consistent predictions both long and short in form has aroused suspicion amongst the elites scholars of Thassalion.

Could this be an effect that the current war of the Runelords is having upon the world’s magic?

Could this be an attempt at Azlant to try and come back from defeat, a last ditch attempt at a failed, racist regime?

No.

This is something far greater.

The empire’s celestial age, the greatest time in the age of legend, a time of peace, prosperity and sanity has long left us.

Now there are those worshipping the peacock spirit, no wonder Lissala has abandoned us.

And who leads this heredical religion? Runelord Xanderghul of course.

His actions are the Violent Scism of Kaer Maga have in my belief have been more a cause of our current situation than even that of the passing of The Wise First Emperor Xin.

Nowadats the Runelords fight their wars blindly and with great hatred, especial Alaznist and Karzoug.

The war may yet burn us all from this world long before what I fear will come to rise.

The name of this book is a reference to this, Apocrypha, texts that could be considered non-canonical.

I consider this text to be an expersion of what I fear for the future, and yet I hope this book is considered the insane scribblings of a mad man.

Something is coming and one thing is certain, if a diety of fate has gone silent it can only be a sign of the end times.”

The rest of the book is blank.

# 3. Letters from the Brass City.

A collection of scrolls.

Half the scrolls smell like the sweetest flower.

The other half smell like magma and ash.

Most have been redacted except this one scroll.

“Dearest Belimarius,

It is with great envy I write this letter to a wizard so powerful and a leader so resourceful.

I shall, however, make my best attempt at keeping letters of such importance as short as possible.

The Garnet Brand is close.

I can feel it, and the small droplets of information that my informants have granted me tell me that it is located in a heavily warded location, bad news? No.

More recently I have been told that the vault that contains the brand may be deep below the city.

I shall be investigating further.

Your search may be at an end.

Your predesecor, Phirandi, was a strong man.

A man to be feared.

He knew the Plane of Fire had what he seeked.

He knew that I was the one to seek it for him.

Yet he tried to make me scared, to fear the application of his Envy.

I am glad you killed him, I do not believe I could have done so without the help of my Patron.

If she even decided to help me that is.

In the event I am ever able to visit Edasseril, thought I will of course wish to see your walls of gemstones and your army of giants, I wish to first gaze upon his corpse.

I have wished to do so ever since I learned that you keep him next to your throne in a force-cage shaped like a coffin. Brillaince, truly.

Your choice of diplomacy with open diplomacy and generous trade shows me why you have gained your position and kept your head.

There is one small favour I do ask of you.

You are no strange to fact that both coin and blood is always spilt when someone wishes to attain titles and positions as powerful as the ones I possess.

This creates many debts to be paid and even more enemies to kill.

At the moment I am able to strain my resources to help your goals of seizing the mythic powers within the gemstone, your very generous donations of the mountains of gold coins along with the magical items, art, gems, slave blood and all the rest, have truly helped to buy off the right people and deal with the wrong people.

This being said, I am no fool.

I wouldn’t be alive if I was a fool.

The rivals who would see me cast into the negative plane will have smelt blood in the flames.

If you were to ever miss a payment I will surely be killed.
You will be left with no information.

You will be killed by your fellow Runelords.

Let’s keep us both alive, best wishes,

Hakim Khalid Suleiman XXIII.

Grand Sultan,

Lord of Flame,

Khan of Magma.

P.S.

The White Mage thanks you for the slave blood.

You will be pleased to know she has drunk all of those who died with hope in their veins and will move on to drinking those who were merciful.”

The letter ends there.

# 4. The Karthian Sphere.

This book, if you could call it that, is a bound series of different pages.

The primary page seems to be a letter or note.

The other pages are diagrams and magical notations.

“The spheres.

Inner SPHERE and Outer SPHERE.

Given the names of these concepts, you might not be too surprised to hear the word: Sphere Magic

Sphere magic is just better.

Sphere magic is Rune Magic, Sin Magic, whatever you wanna call it, sort of.

It’s the other half.

Sin Magic is a bit too generic, technically, TECHNICALLY, Sin Magic just means the increased capacity for casting the specialist’s sin’s particular school of magic.

Rune Magic is an umbrella term for Sin Magic and Sphere Magic.

That brings us to Sphere Magic.

It’s all about improving your spells.

Like breaking the rules.

You may have heard of those new hemo-wizards (blood mages)?

That’s a form of sphere magic.

For your pleasure I’ve been able to compile the instructions of how to make a Runic Teleportation Circle.

What’s the difference between that and a normal teleportation circle?

Time and money, friend.

Time and money.

Oh, and please destroy this book when you are done with it.

If this is found then I am a dead man.”

The information contained within the rest of the papers explains how to make a permeant teleportation circle in 10 minutes for only 3,000 Gold Pieces.

Versus a week for 10,000 gold pieces.

It is up to you what you will do with this knowledge, it will change the world.

# 5. Valto’s Magic over Matter.

This book is a prismatic, rainbow of colours with a soft cover that has the consistency of slime to the touch.

The front cover has the runic symbol of Greed displayed prominently.

It is unclear if this is a physical aspect of the book or, as the name implies, an illusion of the mind caused by the books enchantments.

“Hello Friends,

This book is by me, Khalib Valto!

Who am I?

I am the first apprentice to Runelord Karzoug!

What does that mean?

Well, if and when our mighty Runelord ever chooses to step down then I will happily oblige in taking over the task, a task that would be impossible if it was not for my vast intelligent and mastery of Greed powered transmutation magic!

Anyways, what is this book about?

Well, young students of Greed, I aim to teach you about some pretty big stuff!

The main aims of this book is to teach you about the soul and mythic creatures.

Now normally this knowledge is strictly forbidden, however due to the war you get to learn all about it so that you can better assist our Runelord Master in defeating some pretty crazy demons!

Woohoo!

I hope you are excited!

What is the soul?

The soul comes from the positive energy plane.

A soul when in a living creature is positive aligned.

When in an undead creature it is negatively alligned.

Souls also contain our alignment.

Now you may be wondering about how a lot of souls in Thassilon are “Evil” alligned.

Evil is a concept that has physical form in our universe, it is determined by reality.

If evil is what is needed to get ahead then well, I guess call us evil!

Back to souls, what are they made of?

Well, we don't quite know.

We know that it's the closest mortals can come to accessing pure magic and that mythic creatures can access their soul magic to use MYTHIC POWER!!!

What is a mythic creature?”

Well, mythical creatures are few and far between.

Mythic creatures represent the gap between mortals and Gods.

Technically a God is mythical but their are also deities which supersedes mythical powers by a long stretch!

All of the Runelords are mythical.

So are the lords of heaven,

demon lords,

arch devils,

protean lords,

Primordial inevitables

and more!

Defeating a mythic creatures is only really possible if you are also a mythic creature.

There are excepts especially with mythic creatures of the lower tiers such as some powerful fey lords.

But wait, where do you come in?

Well, you will be working with me to help construct a new super weapon!

This will be what Karzoug will use to win the war.

Read on to find out more.”

The book describes in vague terms a planning process to create this new artifact.

It seems that this book somehow found itself here unfinished.

What you are able to find out is that the name of the artifact was “The Eye of Avarice” and that “Runewells of Greed” were heavily involved to provide power and stability.

# 6. The Dwarven Hammer.

This is a pale brown journal that is titled “The Dwarven Hammer” in tidy joined up handwriting.

Some of the pages have their edges dog eared.

The journal describes that the Dwarves of the Runewild are quite alike the Dwarves of Golarion.

This is strange as Torag created the dwarves of Golarion in the age of creation.

The journal describes how current historical theory puts the Prime Material Plane’s Dwarves as the original dwarves across the multiverse.

How could the Runewild dwarves seem to predate them?

Also, these dwarves are surface-dwelling!

Dwarves only live underground.

It seems that dwarves can adapt to the surface under extraordinary circumstances.

Could Golarion dwarves one day live on the surface?

The journal ends abruptly with this suggestion of dwarven cooperation and/or genocide.

“If such a thing was to occur (the dwarves of Golarion going to the surface), they would be given the choice of joining the empire….or being swatted like flies.”

## 7. A collection of untitled and anonymous scrolls written entirely in Terran.

This book’s covers are made of a type of lightweight stone.

Each page seems to be made of smooth dirt, the dirt is a pale brown.

The ink shimmers brightly at first then only lightly, making it easier to read.

(You can't speak Terran to understand the text.)

The book is filled with images of a strange item made of crystal.

The images show a model fortress made of crystal.

Below the fortress is a set of 8 black crystals forming a 360 degree hilt.

Then below the hilt of black crystals is a bright, brilliant red crystal that forms the handle of this item.

The entire item looks almost natural, it is a jagged growth of crystals.

The various drawings of the item show that the item would seem to pulse between a dark obsiden colour to a warm pink with various hues between it.

The model fortress is made up of carvings of wicked looking spires and crenellated walls (battlements).

Then below the base of the fortress is the eight jet-black crystals and the bright-red crystal.

# 8. “The Start of Sin: A Thassilonian Spellbook For Beginner Spellcasters".

This book seems to be an enhanced version of an “Enchiridion of the Journey-mage”.

The Enchiridion of the Journeymage is the spellbook used across Golarion by spellcasters of the 5th tier with the funds to buy a copy of the book.

The fact that Thassilon’s starter spellbook taught 5th tier magic and cost over 1,000 GP shows both the power and wealth of the empire.

This spellbook contains every common spell up to the 5th level.

The spellbook also contains knowledge of all metamagic feats up to the 10th level.

This book could be used to quickly retrain wizard (or other applicable casters) class feats to feats with the metamagic trait.

With some studying, a reader of this book could gain metamagic feats as bonus feats!

The book mentions that all of the current Runelords carry one of the only copies of the “Enchiridion of the Archmage”.

The “Enchiridion of the Archmage” are the peak of non-mythic Wizard Spellbooks.

This means it is the strongest spellbook attainable with the exception of artefacts, relics and other mythic-tier spellbooks.

The spells inside the Enchiridion of the Archmage are nearly exclusively 10th tier spells that can warp reality to the wield’s will.

These books are believed to be completely extinct in the modern-day and even in the time of Thassilon, it seems only the most powerful spellcasters owned a copy of this book.

# 9. "The Mutable Form." Written by Karzoug, Runelord of Greed.

This book’s covers are a constantly changing material, texture, colour, smell, brightness, etc, etc.

The only constant is the words on the front cover:

“The Mutable Form”.

The book opens with an introductory chapter describing how magic can change and manipulate all things: any form of matter, souls, the elements, the list is endless.

The book then has a title page bearing these words in Thassilonian:

“Fleshwarping.”

Fleshwarping is described as a combination of Rune Magic and Alchemy.

The Sin Magic Sigils provide the energy for the transformation while alchemy stabilises the process, like taking a freshly forged molten weapon and cooling it in water, allowing the subject to solidify, to make their new form permeant without unintentional excessive warping.

There are two types of fleshwarped: those created and those altered.

My limited access to the Runewild has allowed me to study the creatures of this land known as the drow.

The drow people were at one point Aosidhe (elves like ours on Golarion).

The history of the drow of the Runewild sort of started when the humans and the elves formed their alliance in the Witch Wars.

A warlock named Sibra disagreed with the alliance and thus Sibra killed the leader of the elves hoping to blame the humans.

Sibra was found out and banished to the darkest corner of the Runewild.

Sibra took with her a collection of her closest followers and used dark magic to bind her power into their flesh.

Sibra thus created the drow….or so the legend goes.

My research proves that while most Runewild drow has come about via either Sibra’s ritual or the offspring of elves who have partaken in this ritual, not all of the drow’s origins can be linked to the Ritual or Sibra at all.

In fact, the oldest drow of the Runewild (similar to the oldest elves) seems to be as old or older than the Runewild itself.

Where does the Runewild come from?

Does it predate the prime material plane?

And how?

What does this all mean?

These questions are not for this book to answer nor to dwell on.

Instead, I would like to focus upon the ritual that Sibra used to corrupt the drow of the Runewild.

This ritual is fleshwarping.

The ritual may not be as empowering or transformative as Thassilonian fleshwarping and yet it is fleshwarping non the less.

This is a clear sign that Sibra’s drow are quite talented at fleshwarping.

Emperor Xin founded Thassilon on the principle that other race’s technologies, magics, culture, etc could one day rival that of the Azlanti.

This is a clear sign that Xin’s theory is correct, or will turn out to be correct in the long term.

Could the elves of Golarion one day learn fleshwarping independant of Thassilon?

Could they even surpass our fleshwarping knowledge and abilities?

Will this require them to first fall to the corruption as that of the Drow of the Runewild?
Only time will tell.”

The demon lord Haagenti is the creator of the philosopher’s stone, alchemist’s fire and demonic retriever constructs.

Haagenti and his followers experiment in flesh-warping.

Another contender to Thassilon’s crown as the masters of flesh-warping.

…

Sinspawn and Fleshdregs.

Sinspawn and fleshdregs are immortal, which is useful to an empire of immortals.

They also require no food nor water.

The perfect servant, and now they are the soldier of Thassilon.

Fleshdregs are lesser sin spawn that sin spawn can control and manage.

Sinspawn that are have been ordered into areas that cause them to be in prolonged isolation seem to lose their intelligence and go feral.

Further study required.

Althought useful, I find Sin Spawn to be an embarrassment to me personally.

The new modern battle-ready Sin-Spawn are a creation of my bitter rival Alaznist.

These new sin spawn have been created in the millions to bolster the armies of Thassilion in ways many never thought possible.

While this appears to be true, I have my own doubts.

Alaznist is not one for the creation of new things, she is far more interested instead in focusing her brutish intellect on destruction, which of course is fitting for the Runelord of Wrath.

How did Alaznist create these?

I fear outsider intervention.

I fear that war with Alaznist is now inevitable, in which case her wrath-spawn will be aimed at my realm.

I will not fall to her army of rage.

Alaznist is not the only brilliant mind around here.

The other 5 Runelords will be creating their own sin-spawn empowered by their own sin (pride-spawn, envy-spawn, etc).

Each with their own abilities.

Of course I was able to crack the formulae myself as well.

MY greed-spawn will outnumber her wrath-spawn by several magnitudes.

The sin-spawn troops require biological material to create.

Alaznist will remember which one of us is the master of transmutation.

# 10. The Antion Of Dragonkind. Antion is a Thassilonian word for enslaving and binding against one's will.

The front cover depicts imagery of a dead dragon with a sihedron carved into the chest of the dragon.

Atop the dragon’s corpse is the outline of seven shadowy humanoid shapes each wielding spears.

The faces and addition details the of 7 are left vague.

Most likely this is due to the everchanging holder of each of the roles of the Runelords.

This book is similiar to that of a business research report done by an R&D department for shareholders to read.

“Greetings fellow citizens of the Great Thassalonian Empire!

I write this text in the name of the Runelord of Sloth.

This book has been both generously funded and approved by the Church of Lissala.

Dragonkind is broken up in groups of connected types known as “draconic septs”.

There are 5 septs of dragonkind.

It is suspected that there are two more septs that hide in the outer planes, far from even our eyes.

Chromatic dragons: black (water), blue (lightning), green (air and poison), red (fire), white (cold).
Imperial dragons: forest, sea, sky, sovereign, underworld.
Metallic dragons: brass (fire), bronze (water), copper (earth), gold (fire), silver (cold).
Planar dragons: Bliss (Nirvana), crypt (Boneyard), edict (Axis), havoc (Elysium), infernal (Hell), paradise (Heaven), rift (Abyss) and tumult (Maelstrom).
Primal dragons: brine, cloud, crystal, magma, umbral.

Rarity in order: Planar > Primal > Imperial > Chromatic == Metallic .

With the advancements of Thassilon I am sure that one day we will find, capture and study the other two septs of dragonkind.

What secrets they may hold.

The age of creation, dragons and serpents are over.

This is the age of humanity.

We are the greatest of humanity.

The age of the Thassilon is now.

Dragonkind is at a crossroads.

They once ruled this world as the stewards of Golarion.

An age has already passed since the time of this stewardship.

The dragons tried to secure their future in the age of the serpent with their alliance with the serpentfolk.

This has backfired on Dragonkind due to the Azlanti victory in the War of Ydersius-Savith.

The destruction of the serpentfolk empire has fractured an already splintering draconic society.

Already we (the scholars of Thassilonian) can see a decline in dragonkind.

Dragons may be large, wielders of considerable magics and practically immortal but that does not guaratee the continuation of their society.

Already their clans, guilds and organisations are breaking apart.

Dragons have been outpaced by mortals by greater and greater magnitudes as time goes on.

There have been several reactions to this in the draconic world.

The dragons that have clung to the ancient past of the Age of Dragons are starting to retreat from the world of mortals.

They seek caves, dungeons and remote wildernesses to build nests to produce offspring or to build hoards to satify the greed inherient with dragonkind.

The imperial dragons have returned to Tian-Xia, the seat of draconic power during the age of dragons.

They hope to found a new Empire.

The Dragon Empire.

These dragons are isolating themsevles or desertating the continent.

What about those that wish to stay?

To move forward?

To live among us.

That brings us to the Dragon Lords.

The Order of the Dragon Lords is a powerful organisation made up of Draconic Disciples, Draconic Exemplars, the Dragon Knight Champions, and led by the Dragon Riders.

The strongest rider of the order may hold the title of Dragon Lord.

Only those whom bond with their dragon to the point where there mind and soul are truly one may hold the Dragon Lord Title.

If they cannot achieve the rank of Dragon Lord then Dragon Riders can instead aim to get the title of Master Dragon Rider instead to become a leader of the Order.

The strangeness that comes from the requirements of being a Dragon Lord means that theoretically the order could be lord-less until such an individual achieves this.”

…

As you flick through the introductory pages on dragon-kind the book comes to the end of the introduction.

The following few chapters speak in great detail about the current status of the Thassilonian slave trade.

If this book is accurate the trade is booming under the oversight of both the Runelord of Sloth and the temple of Lissala.

The next few pages reads like an advertisement, displaying slave varieties and prices.

The book then explains Dragon Masters.

The full title of “Dragon Master” is Dragon Slave Masters.

The Order of the Dragon Lords are enemies of the Dragon Masters but such a rivalry has yet to explode into all out violence or war.



Dragon Masters are dragon riders force the forging of the soul bond with their dragon by using a magical item called a “Dragon Amulet” to skip the majority of this process and force the connection.

The Dragon Amulets are created using the Orb Of Dragon Mastery.

The Orb of Dragon Mastery is the prize possession of the Dragon Masters.

The Orb of Dragon Mastery is a Minor Arifact, a lesser version of the Lost Orbs of Dragonkind.”

The book then describes how the Dragon Masters could potentially enslave Dragonkind for Thassilon.

The book does explain how such an act could help Thassilon in achieving greater goals however that it is ultimately not worthwhile.

The reasoning is that such an act is sure to cause the empire to collapse in all out civil war as some of the most powerful Thassilonians are Dragon Riders and would see such an act as heresy against their allegiance to dragon-kind.

Instead the book describes that more likely is that Dragonkind will find a place in Thassilon as an ally not a slave.

Then the book describes how the continued creation of Rune Giants and Sinspawn is most likely the future of modern slavery in Thassilion due to their physical strength and endurance.

Eventually possibly replacing slaves of other races.

End of Report Booklet.

# 11. Knocking the Door.

The book is locked.

The grey book is covered in chains, padlocks, etheral-bindings and arcane lock markings.

The name of the book is blue in colour, written in Thassilonian runic arcane notion.

Saying the name of this book causes locks to open and the cover to flip open.

The book opens with the following text:

“The Doomsday Door Must Never Be Opened.

The Doomsday Keys Must Be Hidden.

She has the Coin.

Reality Will Die In Thassilon.”

The rest of the first half of the book is the line:

“Mustn’t Be Opened.”

The second half of the book is blank with the occasional random drawings of circles, some have sinister faces, most are blank.

# 12. Perfect Prismatic Primer. A guide to Azlanti magical technology.

The book is silver with its title and subtitle both in thick purple colouring.

Beyond this, the book seems to have no additional magical features and instead focuses on covering the enemy of Thassilon’s technology in a straightforward way.

The book seems to approach describing the wonders of Azlanti technology from a balanced perspective.

The book noted how advanced and powerful their technologies are without using flowery or overly enthusiastic language.

All of the observations made in this text lack a feeling of intimacy with the subject, instead, the descriptions are that of an observer with the occasional nugget of more substantial information.

As a piece of writing it comes off as a long-form research text.

This could have been a report created and used for military purposes.

The book first explains an item called “Electro-Thaumaturgic Fuse”.

The Azlanti power source.

They also mention the “Skyward Funnel”.

The Skyward funnel absorbs energy from the sky to recharge batteries.

The Skyward Funnels could also be used to analyse the stars of the sky on a clear night.

Prismatic Analyser.

Can detect magic and reveal deep information.

Gravity Guage.

Azlanti magical technology can manipulate gravity.

Their civilisation used gravity in many different applications.

Gravity gauges are Azlanti magical technological devices that have been created to measure the gravity of an area or plane.

A gravity guage can also measure how much the local gravity field’s intensity has been distorted in that given area.

Skyscrapers/Interconnected Skyscrapers.

The name skyscraper has been given to Azlanti buildings that go beyond 100 floors, with some going over 1000 floors.

These Skyscrapers take up relativity little ground space, instead creating space vertically via it's many floors.

Some skyscrapers are designed or later modified to connect to other local skyscrapers via grand walkways, short range teleportation circles, jump runes, portals, etc.

The skyscrapers are used by the largest Azlanti guilds, colleges (magical, technological or otherwise), religious, etc.

The above mentioned interconnections allow these groups to quickly move between buildings, whether it allows for between internal mobility or inter-organisational mobility depends on the situation.

Banking Consortium.

While not a technology, it is an advancement that may be worth noting as an advancement Azlanti banking.

The inward eye are a guild of some of the world's most powerful witches.

The Inward Eye also handles most of the empires bankings.

The inward eye are based in the Azlanti city of Bilith-Vel.

It seems the guild of the Inward Eye is leaded by the only Lunar Dragon known to the Thassilon empire at time of writing.

If our research on this kind of dragon is correct then we may have a problem on the moon.

Rezallian is the name of the lunar dragon.

Engineer’s Work Gauntlet.

This magical clockwork gauntlet is an invention designed to help with the inventing and construction of other clockwork devices.

The development of this device has accelerated the development of Azlanti’s technological developments.

The gauntlet’s magic imbues the wearer with an instinctive knowledge of mechanical devices to both repair and analyse mechanical devices.

The gauntlet also grants Azlanti engineers the ability to immediately analyse a device, learning its purpose, methods of operation and any malfunctions (if present).

These kind of innovations make me think that whilst Azlant may never catch up

Aeon Display.

A three-pronged magical candlestick holder that can hold up to 3 aeon stones.

Any aeon stone placed on the Aeon Display grants its effects to all allies within 30 feet.

Additionally, when 3 aeon stones are placed upon the Aeon Display, the stones shine their light of their colours in a 
large AOE around the wielder.

Current Generator.

A human-sized wind turbine that sits on a tripod.

Halfway down the Generator is a slot for an aeon stone.

The generator has two modes.

The generator can provide infinite steady air output, drawing power from the aeon stone.

The generator can alternatively use local winds or water currents in combination with the aeon stone to create a magical electric current that can also power magical items.

Selective Syringe.

Automatically selects the correct syringe and injects the correct dosage.

# Conclusion of the White Tower Tome Collection.

This collection of books seems to have been gathered from various points throughout the history of Thassilon.

The books combined can give you access to much knowledge of the lost empire along with an insight into the secrets of the arcane and the enemy empire of Azlant.

With this knowledge, you have unlocked the subsystem: magical library.

With this you can gain an item bonus of 3 if you build a library.

This also applies to the other books (Sunken Tower) as well.

Hopefully with the knowledge of an empire you are one step closer to stopping Doomsday.
