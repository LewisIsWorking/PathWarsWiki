## Rune wheel.

> By Ross.

So they ended the seagull island arc, and as a result found this weird thing.

After Tammerhawk and a few other great arcane minds spent time researching it,
they found out they can use the rune wheel as a sort of window into the past. 

We would be experiencing it sort of like actors without a script,
being where we are supposed to be without knowing exactly what our role is.

Tammerhawk ended up spending an entire fortune and like,
every even mildly magical man (I mean seriously, she included carnon in the ritual) to activate it.
Then asked us to view the past and help her sort out her memories.

## Session 221 August 11th. 
Ross
Carnon finds themselves freed from their temporary trap, and immediately finds themselves in a fray. An army of skeletons charging at a strange band of folk.
Carnon springs into action, immediately firing off magic shots, throwing magic shots into the grouping of skeletons. 
Selenor introduces themselves as from Korvosa. 
Allisee starts to craft an item, Carnon attempts to help and makes the Dancing armour for Cardigan. Selenor's 
grandmother needs saving from evil people. 
The spirit realm used to be a prison, and now the evil people are using Grandmother's power. Time loop? In the rune-wild they experienced a Time event.
Four weeks into the future.
Junima was being used to trying to free an evil god from their prison.
The Evil people are 
orcs. Tall mean green orcs. 

## Session 222 August 31st
Ross, 
We open the portal to Selenor's Grandma. 
Outcomes the grandma. 
We Are in a dark, forgotten place. 
The rocks that Viole picks up bring out visions of Doom and destruction.
Carnon picks up a different, smaller rock and his inner connection to the universe DARKENS AROUND HIS FINGERS. 
Carnon drops it and backs away in fear.
Selenor, sensing a competition, picks up a bigger one, and as he does it then EXPLODES. 

Going on a frenzy to try to clear the blocked passage, he clears a few rocks, but one of the rocks fights back,
sliding right through Selenor's hand. 
One of the doors is 9 circles.
One is cracked.
One is merging with another. 
A crystal lotus vision appears.
Most of them are fading in and out and have few details. 
One of them is a symbol for the moon.
This is cracked and damaged.
Selenor explodes more rocks and reveals a tunnel that has had something dragged through it. 
One of Ex Ranger Knight Captain of the Knights of Lost Tim's Wives tries to dig through the black rock,
but the black rock fights back and sends him the vision of more destruction. 
Ex-Ranger Knight Captain of the Knights of Lost Tim becomes CHANGED??
Turns into a sort of EEL.
Unholy eel?
Unholy Consecrated?
Tim gets touched by Viole, and Tim's eel features try to stick onto Viole, and Viole gets a rash. 
Something stops Viole from getting infected.
God symbols, god names make them glow. 

Pharasma, Asmodeus, Crystal Lotus, Sarenrae, Desna, Nhimbaloth, Erastil, cracked deity. Achaekek.

Carnon knows so much. He recognises something rather strange. This seal was made by about 8 different DIVINE castors. 
This strange unlikely alliance was able to channel the power of the deities to create a unifying seal. 
This is a MYTHICAL seal barrier. If this seal is ever to be opened, it means that ever deity allows them to open it. 
Selenor puts his hand in the middle of the door, as his body gets covered in strange, intricate designs. 
He floats centimetres of the ground, as books start to float around him, and he glows in a grey flame, and the door unlocks. 

This motherfucker just channelled 8 different divines, and bypassed their lock. 
Selenor has Screwdriver his screw. 
He has hammered his nail.
He is a cup that has been filled with water. 
"He is a vagina that ha—no too far."

Behind the door is a staircase that descends a few meters, and makes is filled with skeletons. 
Tim says he will guard his wives' rears and stay behind.
(alternatively, his autism makes him count each skeleton).
Some skeletons have necromantic symbols.
Not necessarily unholy, but more vampiric undeath.

As we travel through the crypts, the skeletons pop out, some not being able to fully animate, and instead just the heads pop up, (the source of their reanimation). 
Further into the crypt, a massive hulking bone creature moves ahead, crushing several piles of bones. Above average wyvern. 

Combat Ensues. Allisee explodes and cracks a skeleton into a laser beam of magic. 
Carnon's Gun explodes in his face. Viole spell strikes. Allisee takes 15 minutes to do their turn. Selenor does a lot of damage, Carnon's turn takes 15 seconds. 
Cardigan does good world play. Viole shivers the skeleton's timbres. Selenor does more damage. Allisee does ??? The Totally not drake flies up 20 feet (ca. 6 m), shoots a bone at allisee. 
The skulls does more soul sucking. Allisee is extremely resistant to sucking. (does she not have a soul, therefore immune?) Allisee begs Selenor for help. 
Selenor tries a high jump on moving, shambling ground filled with bones, and surprising everyone succeeds. Carnon strolls down to shoot the skull, and Viole finishes it off. Combat Ends. 

Allisee finds a box with an old draconic sigill, pre Syn Riders. 
Height of their power, before the fall. 
Inside is a bobble head of a dragon.
Ornament?
Syn Rider Merch.
Dragon Pop-Head.
Viole is being pulled by Rovagug? 
Viole tries to pick up a femur to use a club, but Allisee start to harass them about their Femur's an extended warranty.

## Session 223 September 15th

Ross
New room.
Door that is like the first, but it is different! 

Selenor tries to open the door, 
but the symbols slip off the wall 
and become magical dirt that then turns into magical brightly but dimly lit lights in the air. 

This turns into a star map / planetarium. 

1. Pharasma, 
2. Asmodeus, Symbol is there twice
3. Missing
4. Sarenrae,
5. Nhimbaloth, 
6. Erastil.
7. Desna.
8. Mantis god. 


Touching mantis god's grave causes a vision of me being ripped apart, and then a spirit gets sucked into the gravestone.

Selenor does spirit sense and looks to the Pharasma's grave. 
## Session 224 September 21st
Ross
Carnon helps Selenor's new affliction with some herbal medicine. Selenor did not take his fire training safety, and burns his hand on the hot door knob. 
Allisee attempts to judge the worth of the door, and finds out the door judges back. 

Past this door is what appears to be a ritual chamber,
complete with candles and geometric patterns and a gold YouTube play button. 

Lissala appears to be binding something symbolically in this chamber. 

These representations might be demi god tier threats to the universe.

These images are banished from the material plane? 

This room is not very kind to Carnon and must be in cahoots with the corrupt hell knights and Korvosian officials. 

The room is also not kind to Viole. 

Runes of old magic pierce into Viole's thigh, and glow with a white flame light as Viole begins to barbeque,
but then suddenly that light turns into a seven-pointed star, and Viole now plays on an easy mode. 

Viole and Allisee do their best to gaslight a room into thinking they are good altar boys,
and then the book gets a glow up.
The book is the largest source of Lissala Lore.

 Allisee comes up with the in-genius plan of waiting
 because she believes that the bad guys would not have been capable of closing the door behind them. 
Carnon contacts the voices about this plan,
 and both the voices and Selenor agree that waiting is not the best course of action.
 So Viole and Allisee once again cosplay as good altar boys. 
They bring the tablet into the middle of the room, and the statues in the room activate.
 An undead ghoul man, a regular woman, a ware human, Angelic woman. 
As the ritual continues, the faces on the statues shift between thousands of different forms.
 The statues crumble and break at the same time as the door. 
This reveals a doorway, and we all instinctively know that we are about to enter the prisoner chamber. 


Junima is wrapped in shadowy black chains. 

Next to her is Zillith?
Tempest Arrow?
The creature they freed from the Necropolis and Zillith. 
Zillith threatens to kill Junima via the most painful death imaginable.
Selenor is called impulsive. 
Selenor strikes back with a zinger.
Zillith is an agent of death.
The world is coming to an end!
Doomsday is approaching!
War for creation? 
Whom most mortals believe in Rovagug.
A magical pact was sealed, and a deity was sealed.
Four of his followers helped seal that deity. 
Now they must be freed and allowed to interact with the prime material plane.
Aliens are real?
Billions of worlds?? 
Death himself knows of Selenor's Grandfather.
Death fears Grandaddy.

Grandaddy has a lot of magic lore (arcana expert? Less go) Selenor is a great screwdriver. 
Selenor can trade Junima in exchange for releasing the Blackrock Prisoner.
Zillith has bribed and got several of our previous allies with feats of power and might. 
Zillith has *much* reinforcement.
Death has a glimmer in his eyes.
Zillith is not an enemy, but must obey.
The Master must survive. 
The pact must be broken?
The blackrock prisoner's master is the only being besides Rovagug, who is believed to be able to slay Pharasma easily.

Ten Thousand years ago he sold his soul to save his daughter, at the end of the age of Legend,
just as the age of darkness begins. 
Zillith gets called a scaredy-cat.
Selenor has an aura of fear.
Zillith has a powerful ward inscribed on his palm.
Death has restricted freedom, but that restriction is too tight to allow Death to stop Doomsday. 

Selenor will free the blackrock prisoner. 

A Tian Xia woman starts to speak telepathically. 

Junina is a "wee girl". 

Selenor starts to communicate with the blackrock prisoner. 

Selenor, I have come to bargain. 

This man's master will kill death, like it is a small trivial thing. 

Selenor's grandfather was a bookmaker. 

Within Selenor there are pages of books, books written by a traveller. 

The author spoke to everyone, death, angels, Asmodeus, Pharasma and master included.
Death's power comes from the master.
Selenor vows oblivion upon Death.
Master is the god of OBLIVION?
Selenor frees the prisoner, and as he does the multiverse ripples.
The Prisoner snaps his fingers twice, and breaks the chains on Junima, and destroys Zillith's wings.
The prisoner speaks out and says, "Tell the horseman of the apocalypse the fifth is coming".

## Session 225 October 19th

Ross

He has released four of the most powerful fiends that exist. 

Zillith wants to return to the realm of death with his companions.
Selenor wants undead skeletons.
Selenor does indeed receive the skeleton's buddies.

Death begins to grumble and speak a chant, Zillith says "farewell,
as the worst is just ahead of you" and vanishes beneath Death's cloak.

High priest of Sett wants the smoke. High priest of sett is going 1v20 all of the skeletons. Carnon gets paralysed.

## Session 226 November 3rd. 

Ross
Allisee takes all the loot. 
Allisee takes all the loot x2.

The ripples caused by the end of time in nine years. 

Only four people survived doomsday?
Who is Imron?
False harrower.
Life Linked pictured of Sonorae? 
Top hat man?

Ulric has some weird shit with his armour and weapons. 
Strange smell of blood and metal, of battle and fighting. 
This is tangentially related with the marks of Death on Viole and Selenor. 
Some spooky shit.

"I have been burying bodies for a long time now, I have got a shovel ready" Selenor's dog has necrotic flesh,
that will turn into ash. 

The party teleports to Blackrock Inn, which is now nothing more than a smoldering crater. 
Selenor decides that the explosion came from underground, rather than above,
and Junima questions her relation with Selenor, as she does not remember having a child.
Viole and Carnon go off to find a sandwich while Selenor and Junima get dressed for their ice box. 


After Selenor Cardigan Junima and Allisee went into the "icebox". 

Ulric urged the rest of the party to follow him to the Blackrock village where his wife might've gone.
After following Ulric, they see blackrock village in flames and an army of Daemons marching through. 
The Daemons were converting people into more of them or harvesting the souls inside their body.
Ulric decides to basically commit suicide by going towards the army and fighting them. He gets turned into a Daemon.
After this, the party decides to leave the plane of BattleZoo. 

While in the archive of worlds, a Watcher (get picture from PathWars) explains that Abaddon is gathering power rapidly 
and might break into Golarion if we do not do something. 

However, he explains that there might be a ritual able to 
stop them that Amenopheus (I think) knows about and is probably already preparing.

The performing of this ritual will open small rifts in space that will need to be dealt with.

After this,
the party goes to drop off Junima in the rune wild and check on her unborn child's grave because they suspect the child might actually be alive
(and be Selenor's mom Andaisin).
They check out the grave in a valley where a turtle bunny man is cursed with a curse
that forces him to count the number of stones until he has the exact count.

They check on the grave of the unborn baby that was preserved in a sort of glass orb, 
and the glass orb is broken *cliffhanger*!!!!!

Also,
Carnon with his nature skills figures out that the vernal key's ice plane the frozen prison plane has a connection to Yubis. 
This is because of 3 reasons:
1. The elemental lord of water.
2. Jack Frost's connection to Yubis (ice magic).
3. Yubis's ice-magic spirit is stronger in a plane of ice-magic.

## Session 227 November 16th 
Ross
Pre-session discussion.
What is a kitsune, and what is a lie?

Junima and Selenor are being racist to one another, their flames mix like fire and water.
Hag magic is outside the realm of occultism.
Moon hags are related to the moon kraken, but not necessarily?
Correlation?
Rune wild. 
Selenor's magic, moon stuff.
All pieces of the same puzzle, but Allisee cannot quite piece them together.
Selenor has magical cancer, but his body is battle ready.
A poor fate for a man, but Selenor is not quite a man. 

HORI THE RABBIT TURTLE PEBBLE STONE COUNTER. 

The rabbit does not want the pond to be hurt :(

The plan to end the curse: 
Get an infinite amount of bags, put X number of stones in one bag, and an equal number of stones into all the others,
until all rocks are inside the bags.
Multiply one bag count by all the bags, total stone count gathered. 

There is a rallying cry for the grey flame?
Tian Xia voice in Weller's head?
Selenor pops one of his books out; Weller has grey flame magic, not green.
Their magic seems to be happy to interact, but not Junima's.
Weller is scared of us, but also the people that may encounter us. 

The fifth horseman has had FOUR WEEKS TO DO SHIT ON THE PLANET. 

BAD NEWS. 

We are to be killed on sight? 

Viole was almost executed? 

We must gather the shards of sin to increase the strength of the group.

Carnon understands your actions, Lady Keleri. 

Fear is a terrible thing that will drive folk to extremes,
and this situation will turn even the bravest soldier to commit awful sins.
Horsemen of the apocalypse?
Oblivion?
Do you think that this situation, this doomsday, will be prevented by your force of will alone?
By your spell and might?
By your iron grip on magics and contracts? 

Carnon had signed a contract given to him before, by someone in terror of the evils of the world. 

Who swore that Order and Laws will protect Carnon and the city he learned to love.
That contract was then used against Carnon
to attempt to imprison him for the same false allegations that brought him to sign it in the first place. 

Carnon is here to help, for doomsday will break those that he is sworn to protect.
I am your ally, for our enemies are the same.
This Carnon knows, but Carnon will not sign himself to another dictator who hides behind fancy words and signatures.
You want Carnon's help, you must borrow your trust from him.
If you find that Carnon breaks it,
you have surrounded yourself by many powerful people who can help you bring Carnon to justice. 

Keleri Deverin cheap shots Carnon, and knocks them out, putting them into a black site. 

## Session 228 November 23rd.

Ross
Carnon is on Parole. Carnon gets cool bracers. 
Selenor beats cancer with the help of Carnon. Carnon will not get deported and is a civil servant of Magnimar. 
The group is getting ready to enact the plans Keleri has been preparing for some time, to stop these planar incursions. 

Amenopheus wants assistance to create a ritual that will unlock the full power of the Jewelled Sages.

Allisee wants to research and predict where the barrier between Abaddon and Golarion is weakest.
Also, where rifts might appear before this ritual takes place, to be better prepared against these rifts. 

Selenor's Grandfather might be a worry, but it remains to be seen. 

They will keep an eye out. 

Selenor's grandfather is gathering all the forces of Golarion.

Eclipse? Griselda is a force that the group is not cohesive enough to fight yet, they need more battle experience. 

Allisee explains some of her backstory, and that she now possesses half of her Mother's soul. 

Varisians are a lesser version of the Rune lords, giving them the ability to slightly use Sin magic.
They cling to 
the old cities like 'Maggots to a corpse'.

"Each of us is unique, each of us has a story that cannot be replaced".

Selenor cannot destroy his creators, and thus will either need to be provided with a soul gem to preserve them,
or else Selenor must be destroyed before they deal with him. 

We will travel to Osirion, Some supplies are needed for said ritual.
Once those are moved, we will be arriving at a 
stone structure.
Ridiculous?
These plans will develop as we go along, hundreds of components. 
The guard who was also friends with Yubis, who runs the Warden temple?
Wants help to consecrate it. 
Carnon is a minor Aeon?

## Session 229? December 12th
Ross 
(seagull island, which carnon was not a part of, so I did not take many notes)
Allisee takes all the loot.

## Session 231. 2025 January 5th Sunday + 4710 AR, 29th Arodus. + Osirion ritual part 3.

> Sherfield / Lire:

Session 231 Summary
Setting:
Time: 2025 January 5th IRL / 4710 AR, 29th Arodus (Golarion date).
Context: Third part of the Osirion Ritual arc.
Key Developments and Events:
Preparation for Madame Zelekhati Encounter:
Cardigan acquires a map of Osirion.
Selenor struggles with using maps effectively.
Viole's Directive: The group is advised not to escalate or draw blood during the encounter with Madame Zelekhati,
who is revealed to be an elven supremacist.
The Bazaar and its Mysteries:
The group explores the Eto Bazaar,
a chaotic market known for its rejection of Absalom Trade Standards and its mix of financial statuses.
Haggling dominates the bazaar as the group seeks a gift for Madame Zelekhati.
Obo the Candle Merchant:
The group meets Obo, a goblin merchant selling magical, colourful candles and rare magical dust.
Obo's Backstory:

His family's lineage is tied to the Living Prismatic Spear,
an ancient entity described as an eternal guardian of light and flame,
born from chaos in the deep ground.

His mother, Mobo, was known as the "Twilight Wanderer" and a devout worshiper of Sarenrae.

She was killed by the Living Prismatic Spear, leaving Obo with a legacy of grief and vengeance.
Magical Offerings:
Obo offers Envy Dust, a rare substance found in the ruins of the Ancient Osirion and Sin Empire, for 9 gold pieces.
The dust is said to enhance or dispel abjuration magic.
Condition: The party must swear to confront the Living Prismatic Spear to gain Obo's full support.

Archon Star Mace:
A family heirloom obtained generations ago from the vault of the Living Prismatic Spear.
Obo offers the mace to the party, describing it as linked to a “tear in the veil” between worlds.

Carnon's Experience: While holding the mace, Carnon has a vivid vision of being crushed by a golem in a starry expanse.
Gold Rush and Hidden Riches:
The discussion reveals that much of Osirion lies buried beneath hundreds of feet of sand,
hiding untold artefacts and treasures.
If fully unearthed, Osirion could become a world superpower.

Lire's Contribution:
Lire records Obo's tale in a written work titled "The Candle Soul Legacy" and gifts it to Obo.

The Candle Soul Legacy
Written by Lire, this tale captures Obo's history and motivations:
Mobo, the Twilight Wanderer: Obo's mother, a devout follower of Sarenrae, wove divine tales into her trade.
The Living Prismatic Spear: A demigod born of chaos and ancient magics, responsible for Mobo's death.
Obo's Resolve: Driven by vengeance, Obo seeks heroes to challenge the entity that claimed his mother and threatens the divine order.

> Lire's message to Obo.
>> - Lire scribes this tale and hands a copy to Obo.
>> - The Candle Soul Legacy
>> - In the golden sands of Osirion, where ancient secrets whisper to the winds, there lived a merchant of renown, Obo of the Candle Soul. 
>> - His name echoed in the bazaars, a beacon of both wealth and wisdom. 
>> - But beneath the shimmering veneer of success lay a tale etched in vengeance and sorrow.
>> - Obo's mother, Mobo, was the true architect of their family's legacy. 
>> - Known as the "Twilight Wanderer", 
>> - she wove tales of gods and stars into her trade, her devout worship of Sarenrae granting her both fortune and fervour. 
>> - Yet it was not the desert sun that claimed her life, but an entity of unfathomable power—the Living Prismatic Sphere, 
a living demigod born of ancient magics and unbridled wrath.
>> - Years passed, and the grief hardened into resolve within Obo. 
>> - His family’s connection to Sarenrae was deeper than most understood. 
>> - They bore a spiritual truth known as the Candle Soul—a fragment of divine light that had illuminated their lineage for centuries.
>> - Obo swore to avenge his mother and unravel the mysteries of the Sphere. He knew he could not confront such an entity alone. From the depths of the Inner Sea to the towering spires of Absalom, he sought heroes with the courage to defy a living god. He offered them riches and relics, though his true gift was the promise of purpose: to confront an entity that mocked the divine order itself.

## Session 232 February 1st? 

Ross
Carnon makes Cardigan a puzzle box to distract her from saying anything weird,
or staring too much while we are inside the brothel. 

We make somewhat?
Plan to try to speak with Madame Zelekhati and gain the info we need out of her.
We get split up, as the bodyguards get left behind while the faces go speak with the Madame. 

My internet cuts out midway through his conversation, so I do not get much more.

## Session 233 March 8th

Ross

We questioned a little what our next steps should be.

Then Allisee had the idea to try to locate the weapons of the Assassins, narrowing down the search to just the 
armour.
We found the direction of the armour to be "up, and a little back" We proceeded to look for illusions or 
hidden doors to the attic, and were in luck. 

Using Selenor's superior will, he disbelieved the illusion and we ventured upwards.
In the attic, we found schematics for a base camp, and an altar.
We also found out that Selenor has never had a pizza before.
They called it "A flat sandwich", his undead nature really did turn him into a monster.
This is around when you return to us.

You spoke with the spirit that was still lingering here,
and we discovered that the assassin might be underground, close to this shop.
We ventured forth, Carnon found a junkie's needle, and the group discovered the entrance to the sewers.
We climb into the sewers, and Carnon's instantly spot the false wall that hides the Assassins lair.
Carnon warns everyone about potential traps, proving their theory by pointing out the grenade stuck to the wall.
Allisee investigates and finds it to be a cow pie, but the trap warning rings true.
We approach the wall, cautiously, and find no traps, but we do detect a religious aura from the wall.
After some frustrating conversation and theorising, we find the right pass phrase and venture inside.
Allisee dismantles a trip wire trap,
and we find the sleeping red mantis assassin, worse for wear by their previous altercation with Viole.

## Session 234 March 15th. 

We speak with the assassin, Selenor does amazing diplomacy. 

The assassin has a Magma Fire Dragon time locked inside a chest??? 

A collared time locked rhino magma fire dragon. 

PathWars, who has started a session on time exactly 0 times, complains about time-wasting. 

The servant will inform the assassin when our task is complete so she can stay safe inside the room. 

We argue about what our mission is, before deciding to go to the crime boss and convince him the danger is over,
using the props acquired from the assassin.

Hopefully this concludes the fetch quests.
Lire skillfully lie to the henchmen of the Fingers gang, and PathWars almost forget to give us the quest reward. 

Allisee struggles to recall what the assassin's name was. Lire and Selenor speak in minecraft skeleton noises. 

Lire suggest bringing the scribe to the scene of our success,
and casts suggestion on the scribe to ensure our lies all check out on paper.
Scribe succeeds,
so we go to our backup plan 2. Lire spends 10 minutes creating an illusion
while Carnon distracts the Scribe by talking about their schooling.
The scribe sees through the illusion, but luckily Lire's trained ears sense this lie.
Lire successfully mind controls the Scribe into getting her to believe our lie, "A lie for a lie"
and we successfully lie to the scribe. 

We finally return to the hundred fingers gang, but it turns out we are not welcome! 

Carnon intimidates his way into the alley, and Selenor begins to try to diplomacy his way out of this,
and MYTHICALLY succeeds, turning this child into his service.
Another slave acquired.
Tom leads to us his boss.
We intimidate the next guy, who leads us to his boss.
We find the room empty, but quickly chase down the base following a lead. 

We find her atop a fire escape, and Carnon quickly catches up to her. We go to Torch, and hilarity ensues. 

We are forced to explain why we did not just kill a ruthless assassin. 

We barely do.
Reno gains sentience and ten levels.
We are now being *forced* to kill the assassin.
Reeno will lead the way.
We find the assassin, kill them and their golems in one round, and return to torch with a bucket of blood.
Torch is happy with our progress.
Selenor speaks with the halfling woman who runs the Hundred Fingers Gang.
