## Doomsday Fun-time: The Story so far...

### The Campaign

Doomsday Fun-time began in 2018 and has run for over 266 sessions, making it the longest-running campaign in the Path Wars universe. 

Set primarily in 4710 AR, the campaign follows a party of heroes based out of Sandpoint and Magnimar as they uncover an apocalyptic conspiracy threatening to bring about the end of the world itself. 

What started as local adventures dealing with goblins and ancient ruins has evolved into a sprawling epic involving Sin empire artifacts, divine machinations, planar incursions, and the fate of nations.

The campaign is divided into two major parts: Part 1 (Sessions 1-127) established the foundation through six major story arcs, while Part 2 (Session 128 onward) saw a campaign restart with an almost entirely new party—only Cardigan continues from the original group. 

The new heroes inherited the "Heroes of Magnimar" mantle and escalated the stakes to cosmic proportions.

---

### Part 1: The Foundation (Sessions 1-127)

The original party cut their teeth on Varisian adventures, establishing themselves as the "Heroes of Magnimar" through a series of interconnected storylines:

**The Thistle Top Arc** introduced the party to the dangers lurking in the hinterlands around Sandpoint, dealing with goblin tribes.

**The Murder Arc** saw the heroes turn investigators, unraveling a series of killings that revealed darker forces at work in the region.

**The Shard of Lust Arc** brought the party into direct contact with Sin empire artifacts—fragments scattered across Varisia.

**The Tomb of Tular-Sept Arc** delved into ancient crypts and the undead horrors within, uncovering secrets about Golarion's past that would echo throughout the campaign.

**The Belhaim Arc** took the heroes to the village of Belhaim, where dragon-related troubles tested their mettle and expanded their reputation.

**The Harrow Arc** introduced the mystical Harrow deck as a major campaign element, with the cards serving as both divination tools and gateways to stranger realms.

---

### Part 2: The Escalation (Sessions 128-Present)

Session 128 marked a campaign-restart on 7th Erastus, 4710 AR. 

With the exception of Cardigan, an entirely new party of heroes took up the mantle of the Heroes of Magnimar. 

The scope of the adventure expanded dramatically from here.

#### Arc 1: Skull Hill (Sessions 134-138)
The party confronted the Moon-Flower, a dangerous plant creature of lunar origin. 

Drekk-Zal distinguished himself by channeling lunar magic to defeat the aberration, establishing the party's ability to handle supernatural threats.

#### Arc 2: Collapsing Halls (Sessions 142-146)
Amar joined the group during this dungeon delve.

Which culminated in a battle against the Time Watcher—a creature tied to temporal anomalies that hinted at the campaign's deeper themes of fate and predestination.

#### Arc 3: Truth Teller (Sessions 148-150)
At Lion Fell Keep, the party encountered one of the proto sin blades—ancient weapons predating the Sin-Lords' corruption of Sin empire magic. 

The blade Truth-Teller would become Selenor's signature weapon.

#### Arc 4: The Harrow Realm (Sessions 153-189)
This massive 37-session arc proved transformative. 

Amar's connection to the Harrow deepened until he became The Harrower itself—a being of immense mystical significance. 

Session 158 marked Anthony's introduction to the campaign as Allisee, who would become one of the party's core members. 

The party navigated the surreal landscape of the Harrow Realm, confronting manifestations of fate, destiny, and the strange beings that dwell between the cards.

#### Arc 5: Necropolis (Sessions 184-187)
A shorter but intense arc dealing with undead threats and ancient burial grounds.

During this period, Selenor achieved the mantle of Eternal Warden—a title carrying significant responsibilities and powers related to the protection of sacred boundaries.

Including the ability to bind undead and speak with the grave-touched.

#### Arc 6: Gauntlight (Sessions 190-212)
The haunted lighthouse of Gauntlight drew the party into a 23-session investigation of its cursed depths. 

The dungeon's horrors tested the heroes repeatedly, revealing connections to broader threats facing the region. 

The party's eventual success led Magnimar to formally claim Gauntlight as territory.

#### Arc 7: The Junima Rescue (Sessions 213-225)

*Timeline: Erastus 29th to Arodus 29th, 4710 AR*

This arc sent the party to the Black Rock Mines and beyond to rescue Junima, Selenor's grandmother. 

What began as a rescue mission uncovered divine seals, ancient crypts, and terrifying cosmic truths.

**Session 213-216: Black Rock Investigations**
The party discovered Junima's cryptic letter at the Blackrock inn and met Welter, an oracle scholar specializing in sin-empire lore. 

Amar formally became a Harrower on Erastus 26th, gaining divinatory abilities that would prove essential. 

James Dark-moon, the high captain of the city guard, gave Amar a tracking ring after showing him disturbing visions of Earth's warfare history.

**Session 217: The Divine Serpent's Gift**
At a spider warehouse, Allisee activated a ritual scroll that summoned Tuds, the Undying Divine Serpent. 

Tuds revealed the ancient war between the Banner Callers, Lissala, and the Moon Goddess—a conflict that shaped the cosmology of Golarion. 

Allisee received a sin-ring that implanted a slither of the goddess Lissala into her soul, manifesting first as a greed tattoo that would later shift to envy. 

A morphing ballroom gown materialized as a physical expression of this change. 

They learned of the Black-rock prisoner—a servant sealed by nine deities whose identity remains obscured.

**Sessions 218-220: New Allies and Dark Revelations**
Locus the astral dragon (310 years old post-ritual) joined the party as a Psychic/Monk. 

Viole Jule Grace arrived—an Angel-kin/Grim-spawn elf, 223 years old, potential vessel for Viole-kan Blackrock (the sealed prisoner behind the Nine-Circle Door) with Lissala rune tattoos covering their body. 

The party discovered Allisee's mother is Yubis Dara, connecting Allisee to dragon-lord bloodlines.

**Sessions 220-222: The Nine-Circle Door**
Deep in the mines, the party encountered a door sealed by nine divine symbols: 

Pharasma, Asmodeus, Crystal Lotus, Sarenrae, Desna, Nhimbaloth, Arestil, Achaekek, and one MISSING deity. 

Selenor bypassed the mythical divine seal—an act that would have consequences. 

Selenor contracted stage 1 magical-radioactive cancer. 

Raokan, a servant of the Fifth Horseman, was inadvertently released.

**Sessions 223-224: The Daemonic Contract and Frozen Prison**
In a desperate moment, Selenor signed a daemonic contract with Death itself, gaining a permanent death tattoo on his right hand. 

Death's squad—Zillif, Tempest, Verda, and skeletal soldiers—pursued the party through a frozen prison plane.

A plane connected to Yubis via elemental water magic, Jack Frost, and ice arcana. 

The party visited the Library of Dead Worlds and met the Watcher, who revealed the Horsemen were attacking multiple worlds simultaneously. 

At the Runewild, they discovered Junima's stillborn child's grave was empty.

**Session 225: Junima's Truth**
Selenor consoled Junima about her history of abuse and loss, including her miscarriage with Camadaithe (an ancient pre-material-plane elf from the Runewild who runs a tavern of dancing undead resisting Griselda's rule). 

The stillborn child was later resurrected and grew up to become Lady Andaisin—Selenor's mother. 

For his defiance of the divine order, Selenor was formally denounced by Pharasma. 

The party used Find the Path crystals to locate Plethyn and continue their journey.

---

#### Arc 8: Untangle the Past / The Eto Expedition (Sessions 225-251)

*Timeline: Arodus 28th to 31st, 4710 AR*

This 21-session arc expanded the campaign's scope to Osirion and the ancient mysteries of the Final Spell.

**Session 226-228: Sandpoint and Seagull Island**
Returning to Sandpoint, Selenor beat his cancer with a DC35 check—a moment of triumph. 

Lisa Tammerhawk embraced Allisee (and revealed disturbing interest in dissecting Viole's rune-marked body). 

Bounty #7 took a team to Seagull Island, where the wizard Zarzan Quilit revealed the RuneWheel.

A building-sized artifact creating temporal connections to events in Riddleport circa 4665 AR. 

This device would prove essential to the cross-campaign narrative.

**Session 229: Selenor's 100th Session**
At the Creation Forge, Selenor met Tony Spark and achieved the Chronicler prestige class. 

A massive retcon revealed Selenor had unknowingly stopped Horsemen invasions through forging a deal between Death and Asmodeus. 

The Tallinn Garden plane was released from Hell's archives and placed under Selenor's management. 

He must deactivate a daemonic artifact, or Hell Knights will hunt him—a contract signed retroactively during the Crimson Throne campaign in 4709 AR.

**Sessions 230-231: New Allies and Faction Business**
Lire joined the party—an undead Hell knight revenant affiliated with the Dark Archive.

He came seeking Selenor's blessing for their relationship with Anamarie. 

Carnon spoke with Tammerhawk about "very insightful" matters. 

The party conducted faction meetings with Magnimar, Osirion, Andoran, Exchange, Concordance, and Lantern Lodge representatives before departing for Eto.

**Sessions 231-240: Eto Investigations**
In Eto, the party navigated a web of intrigue:
- Met Grand Master Torch in the House of White Uraeus, gaining intelligence and questionable alliances
- Encountered Obo the goblin candle merchant, whose mother Mobo was absorbed by the Living Prismatic Sphere
- Discovered Madame Zelekhati, an elven supremacist worshipping Alseta and the Elemental Lord of Earth at the Dancing Dunes
- Found Red Mantis assassins hunting targets in the city
- Learned about missing puppets worldwide from Adesha the Nagaji
- Gathered information on Professor Ionacu Lozar, secretly a water genie
- Received a meteorite in a glass orb from Valindriel Gatekeep—a key to "the most powerful door in reality" that Alseta herself fears

**Sessions 241-248: The Pillars of the Sun**
At the ancient site, the party faced three trials under Mektep-Han's guidance:
- **The Necromancer's Test**: Combat and magical challenges testing their resolve
- **The Living Library**: A surreal test with books representing each party member, hourglasses controlling magical effects, and illusory scorpions. 
- The party discovered tactics involving the silver hourglass (doubling book effects) and golden hourglass (brightness bonuses)
- The trials referenced Crumbling Tower, the Lost Prince's plane, and a raven symbol matching Allisee's crow-book

**Session 249: The Final Spell Fragment**
Mektep-Han revealed pre-Osirion history: 
Urgathoa attacking for the Horsemen, Nethys helping create the Curse-breaker. 

After combat with Apophis, Selenor obtained ONE-THIRD OF THE FINAL SPELL plus Sanditt. 

Mektep-Han mentioned meeting a Tian-Xia woman with a soul identical to Selenor's.

**Sessions 250-251: Carnon's Fall and Departure from Eto**
The arc's darkest turn: 
Carnon sold his soul to The Pale, transforming into a "Pale Soul" with True Demon blood and adopted demon ancestry. 

He enslaved Madame Zelekhati through mind-warping magic. 

The Dancing Dunes fell to Lamashtu and The Pale—all native elves enslaved with demon blood.

Haku Stormfan, having appeared from Allisee's crow-book, signed the party charter and officially joined the Heroes of Magnimar. 

Amenopheus identified Haku as a powerful ally connected to ancient forces.

---

#### Arc 9: Allisee's Tea Mastery (Sessions 251-260)

*Timeline: Wealday Arodus 31st to Rova 10th, 4710 AR*

What appeared to be a personal quest for Allisee to master the art of tea-making spiraled into political intrigue, arena combat, prophetic visions, and a mass poisoning threatening to ignite continental war.

**Session 251: Transition and Cross-Campaign Event**
The party returned to Magnimar via Amenopheus. 

Para-countess Zarta Dralneen received Allisee's request to pursue tea mastery. 

A MAGNI WATCH CROSS-OVER event occurred—the party met their counterparts from campaign #4. 

At Zarta's secret party, Lord Kasmarck attended alongside dancing halflings over hot coals. 

The party discovered a plot to poison the Lord-Mayor during the upcoming festival. 

Allisee brewed Memory Tea for the nobles while Haku performed and Viole created magical barriers against psionic feedback.

**Session 252: Rova 2nd - The Lich Storm**
Elisa Tammerhawk warned that Torch is "a scumbag" and revealed Professor Lozar's true nature as a water genie. 

BOUNTY 8 took the party to Ustalav where a lich cast twin chain lightnings, killing hundreds. 

Carnon's snake Appollon was revealed. 

At the Crimson Bazaar in Underbridge, the party defeated berserk flesh and carrion golems. 

The Collector bumped into Allisee with the cryptic words: "Sorry for bumping into you, it was nice to finally meet you." 

Allisee freed seven halfling babies destined for slavery and brewed Liberation Tea to free the slave Marta Kelindra.

**Sessions 253-255: The Golem-works and Graveyard Consecration**
The party worked with Vara Lamm (wife of Thaddeus Lamm) at Magnimar's main graveyard, where a Death Oracle was sapping life force. 

Haku, Allisee, and Selenor created a permanent undead ward—a seed of Selenor's necromantic magic. 

This granted Allisee the ability to brew Corpse Chat Tea once daily in Magnimar.

At the Golemworks, Master Toth Bhreacher tested the party with construct combat. 

Ten stacks of CHAOS accumulated. 

Toth revealed he knew Selenor's mother was Andaisin, and discussed Otari's trapped soul in Gaunt-light. 

Perphenius Galen left the party for "other work."

**Sessions 255-258: The Dream Parlour and Blood Courts**
Para-countess Zarta Dralneen guided Allisee through increasingly surreal tea ceremonies:

*Dream Parlour Sequence:*
- Phase 1: Entering the Dream - Mental and physical barriers against addiction and identity loss
- Phase 2: The Dream Market - Creating Dream-Tea to help people stop harmful escapism
- Phase 3: The Nightmare Market - Brewing Nightmare Tea while stealing nightmare cups
- Phase 4: The Collective Unconscious - Encountering the Weeping Child and Weeping Woman
- Phase 5: Telepathic Tea - Achieving critical success connecting 160+ dreamers

During the Dream Market, Carnon witnessed the Collector extracting grubs from dreaming victims.

The party saved Kira, who returned to her mysterious caped patron.

- Mortigus becoming general of the Army of Iron, leading them to conquer the world

**Sessions 259-260: The Night Hag Attack and Political Fallout**
On Rova 8th, the party visited Eldariel Eldarielm about water elemental lore, learning Allisee's droplet tattoo represents a cursed connection between the Plane of Water and the Prime Material—a passed-down mark. 

Maroux (Yubis's partner = Korumun. Korumun's best friend = Felaki. Marous = Felaki's sister) revealed she hates Allisee, calling her "a cunt."

The grand party on Day 7 descended into chaos. 

Six Night Hags attacked. 

Mass poisoning struck via the Unity Tea. 

Zarta Dralneen was arrested. 

Korvosa blamed, with Cheliax backing Korvosa.

**Session 260: Rova 9th - War Preparations**
The party, imprisoned overnight, was released after Selenor explained the rat goddess conspiracy and daemonic manipulation to Amenopheus. 

He revealed that Allisee's sister works for the Rat God and orchestrated everything.

Lord-Mayor Haldmeer Grobaras assigned critical tasks:
- Allisee: Forge alliance between Taldor and Magnimar
- Party: Formally claim Gauntlight as Magnimar territory
- Party: Train the Magni Watch
- Mortigus: Secure Sky Citadel dwarf alliance

Viole was promoted to general, now constructing a war airship. 

A bounty was placed on Allisee's sister. 

All Harrow beings have returned to the mortal plane.

---

#### Arc 10: The Harrowed Legacy of Amar (Sessions 261-266)

*Timeline: Rova 10th, 4710 AR*

With war looming and the Harrow Realm bleeding, the party sought to understand Amar's legacy and collect the scattered Destiny Deck cards.

**Session 261: Always One Step Ahead**
The party investigated Jacky's shop in Magnimar, hunting the daemon Alla the Boring Rat who escaped via translocate. 

In the séance room, they found a chalk map marking four locations (three moderate, one major importance). 

Haku and Infinite Fang each stole fine harrow decks. 

The conspiracy board showed pictures of the party, history of artifacts, sea monster tattoos, and Paradise Corporation Reclamation information.

Carnon blew a hole in the wall searching for the glowing Deck of Harrowed Tales. 

Herbalist Locke from next door helped board up the damage. 

Haku discovered THE VISION Destiny Deck Card in a hollowed-out anti-magic book, plus four 6th-rank scrolls (quench, heroism, slow, telepathic bond).

**Session 262: Kyver's Island and the Tattoo Master**
Part of Jacky's soul was trapped in a soul gem. 

Through Talking Corpse, the party learned about the Harrow seekers' goals. 

At the Paradise Corporation salvage yard on Reclaimed Island, they met Clem the orc (steampunk pickaxe enthusiast) and Derek the magic card collector with a seven-pointed star hand tattoo.

At The Kraken tattoo parlor, Aaron Mayo discussed Allisee's droplet tattoos—fey magic origin, with someone possessing a paired tattoo. 

Mayo had visions of a celestial crow and uncertainty about whether Allisee would be Cheliax's savior or conqueror. 

Allisee unlocked FIEND WARDING TATTOO and received one on her back.

**Session 263: History Reliquary**
Allisee made perfect scones (natural 20, 44 total) for lizardfolk historian Zorak Grimsby. 

The party traded knowledge: Selenor gave blood, Haku gave a Tengu Gale blade, Carnon gave a +1 Mummy Lord Spear. 

At an eel soup shop, Allisee was attacked. The party tracked enemies to "Horse Forge."

**Session 264: Combat at Horse Forge**
The party fought daemon servants. Highlights included:
- Selenor winning initiative with 44
- Haste cast on six party members via shard of greed
- Fuq Tank getting their first kill of the campaign
- Haku contracting Daemonic plague (later cured)
- Cardigan reaching level 13

**Session 265: Derek's Confession**
Derek, shaking with fear, learned daemons killed Jacky. 

He surrendered THE CARNIVAL Destiny Deck Card to Allisee. Cardigan cured Haku's Daemonic plague.

**Session 266: The Harrow Bleeds**
In the Harrow Realm, Selenor told Sonnorae that Amar "is not quite fully dead somewhere." 

The Harrow itself is bleeding—a sign of catastrophic instability. 

At Smith's Volcano, Selenor comforted Voricose the Cyclops Bartender. 

The Ticktock Man was impressed by Carnon's engineering knowledge.

Keleri spoke with Jyronn Imikar. 

Allisee and Selenor discussed which party member should become the new Harrower. 

Cardigan placed the Deck of Harrowed Tales inside the blood toad on Selenor's shoulder.

At the Cathedral of Abadar, the party agreed to wait until more members can cast 7th-rank spells before attempting the Harrower succession ritual.

### The Heroes

**Cardigan** — Cleric, Level 13 (GM-controlled)
The sole survivor from Part 1's original party. 

Born 4664 AR, she is 46 years old. 

Created by Queen Frilogarma (the Dark Fey Queen) as a failed experiment. 

Her twin brother Boggly Green stabbed her at their mother's command.

She fell through a trapdoor from the royal room of the Dark Fey's upside-down Underdark city, plummeting through a deep shaft to the prison of Rovagug himself. 

Rovagug "revived" her on the surface as a flesh-warped Cleric of Rovagug. 

Since then, Cardigan's mind has been warped: she was always silly and loved combat, but now she is more airheaded and loves the *taste* of violence. 

Later found and raised by the dragon-lord Yubis Dara, making her Allisee's adoptive sister. 

Her connection to the RuneWheel creates a temporal paradox where she can experience events surrounding her own birth during the Riddleport campaign. 

Likes rum & raisin ice cream.

**Selenor The Wanderer** — Champion/Oracle (Bones mystery), Level 12 (Horia)
Perhaps the most transformed character in the campaign.

His necrotic arm (since Session 189) and the death tattoo on his right hand mark his daemonic bargain. 

His full plate armor is etched with esoteric magical runes that even Keleri cannot identify.

Selenor has become famous across Avistan. 

His proto sin blade Truth-Teller prevents him from lying and deals extra fire damage to those who have deceived him.

### Major Artifacts and Items

#### Proto Sin Blades
Ancient weapons crafted in High-Vale, the mountaintop cities of the Rune-wild elves. 

Each blade is a +2 Striking Longsword (level 10 item) with a shifting rune and unique properties. 

The High-Vale Ritual allows copying runes to other weapons daily. 

Most significantly, wielding a proto sin blade unlocks dual-class potential within the wielder's soul.

| Blade         | Sin               | Effect                                                                  | Current Owner        |

The Heroes of Magnimar have come far from their humble beginnings in Sandpoint. From goblin-slaying adventurers to figures of continental significance, they now stand at the crossroads of history. 

The Harrow bleeds, war threatens, prophecies loom, and somewhere, Amar exists in a state between life and death.

The doomsday clocks continues to tick. 

The question is not "if" the clocks will ever reach midnight... but whether the heroes can stop it when it does.
