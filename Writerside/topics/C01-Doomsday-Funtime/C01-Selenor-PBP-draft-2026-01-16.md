# C01-Selenor-PBP-draft-2026-01-16

> Selenor raises three fingers:
>> - I also think of 3 things:
>> - "1: I partially earned her trust when I saved the nobles from the daemon corruption and placed a ward on the cemetery."
>> - "2: You still haven't told me anything about this professor or what I need to do to buy the high-mourner time."
>> - "When the plagued doctor mentioned his third point. Selenor visually can be seen emotionally hurt."
>> - "3: I have never worshipped any god. Not even Nethys who I consider an… old friend from a past life." 
>> - "I respected your church because D'bear chose to adopt me as her son instead of killing me and for the fact that you have an important divine role." 
>> - "I will remind you what you say is empty words."
>> - "Pharasma followers’ actions showed me that she never respected me like I do even tho she could have informed you to at least ignore me." 
>> - "I have never caused trouble and I have always protected your church even tho your actions I could consider an act of betrayal."
>> - "Using my mother to trick me into being your divine slave is a low blow even from you."
>> - "I have high expectations of you Pharasma unlike with the other gods such as Sarenrae, Zon-Kuthon, Asmodeus or the Red mantis god who have broken their ancient vow to never touch Golarion."
>> - "I know you know who I am hence why are you gods are so desperate to own my soul, but you are correct about one thing."
>> - "I am doomed for eternity."
>> - "An eternity you have chosen for me, I might add."

> Selenor remains silent for a few seconds and says this in a sad tone mixed with disappointment:
>> - "You fear my grandfather, don’t you?"
>> - "This is why you want my soul." 
>> - "You present yourself as a saviour, yet you use the same tactics, like Asmodeus and Zon-Kuthon or even Nethys." 
>> - "Manipulation, gaslighting and in your case as well as Zon-Kuthon using my family as a bargaining chip to force me to do your bidding." 
>> - "If you really wanted to 'save' me you would have been honest with me from the beginning." 
>> - "One good example is that so called 'Dawn-Flower' priest." 
>> - "You can’t expect me to trust you if you are going to lie to my face like that."
>> - "You all are the cause of the endtimes..." 
>> - "I am not your enemy Pharasma." 
>> - "If I was why wouldn’t the horsemen reach out to me to recruit or enslave me to their cause?" 
>> - "Just like the other so-called 'heroes' did."

> Selenor eyes then show a look of rage fuelled by sadness as grey fire bursts from his eye sockets.
>> - "My fate was, is, and it will be decided by my family or rather by my grandfather."
>> - "If you really want to help me then tell me how to save the high-mourner, tell me how to save magnimar, tell me how to save Golarion..."
>> - "Inform me how to stop or at least to buy you time. Please..."
>> - "I have given everything hence why my name is Selenor." 
>> - "Just like the void I am now nothing." 
>> - "A mindless revenant that wanders the world you have damaged in your greed for power and control over it."
