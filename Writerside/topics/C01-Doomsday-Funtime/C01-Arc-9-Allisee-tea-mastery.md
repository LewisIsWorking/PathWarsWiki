## Between session 255 -> 256 play by post.

4710 AR, Rova 6th, Toilday: A work day.

At some point, Keleri leaves her office to talk to the party for the first time since Eto.

Keleri explains that she has been deep in administrative work.

This work has been to help smooth over the issues and repercussions created by the party's actions in Eto.

Keleri asks the party now that the party has been reconfigured to be back to full strength to vote on leadership, especially now that the party has discussed the issue.

Keleri puts a series of runestones on a table.

Each runestone has the name of each member of the Heroes of Sandpoint etched onto the surface of the runestone.

The runestone detects who activated the stone, and each stone can only be activated once by each person.

A vertical stone tablet shows a bar chart of the votes (runestone activations) of each member.

> The leader of the Heroes of Sandpoint. You pick more than one person & you can vote for yourself if you wish.
