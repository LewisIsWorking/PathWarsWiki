# Cardigans-Dream

- Selenor,
As you rest your head on Cardigan's lap, your eyelids grow heavy surprisingly quickly.

- Despite being unconscious, you hear Cardigan's words echo in the mind-scape of your dreams...

" Hush, little dreamer, close your eyes,
While the stars paint the Void's dark skies.
He slumbers, a cosmic might,
Dreaming dreams of endless nights."

"Once he raged, a comet of fire,
Shattering worlds in his world-ending pyre.
But now he's chained, by heroes bold,
His power restrained, a story told."

"He stirs in the deep, a leviathan's form,
yet fear not, dear child, safe and warm.
His hunger sleeps, his rage lies still,
Only whispers of chaos his slumber to fulfill."

"The void may echo with whispers of dread,
But Starlight's Shield holds the nightmare at bay instead.
So rest your head, let worries fade,
He sleeps, and the world is saved."

"Sleep soundly now, the stars alight,
He dreams, and the world sleeps tight."

- There is something very wrong with what Cardigan is singing. In Selenor's mind, the words take physical form, moving all around Selenor, ducking, diving, weaving, and whipping about, full of fancy and purpose. Horror. Dread. Fear. These are not Cardigan's words. Someone, someone speaks through her, as a puppet with no words, nor does that of the long-dead corpse. Two corpses. Dancing, diving, playing around. We are already dead. You are already dead.

"Hush, little dreamer, close your eyes,
Forget the void where darkness lies.
He sleeps, a world away;
His hunger stilled, for now, he'll stay."

"Lullaby, lullaby, stars alight,
The Devourer slumbers through the night.
No meteors fall; no tremors shake,
Only starlight on the lullaby lake."

"Legends whisper of a cosmic maw,
Where stars are dust and giants fall.
But fear not, child, the day's at hand,
When brave heroes make a final stand."

"Sleep soundly now, the heroes rise,
Their courage burns in starlight skies.
They'll face the beast, and hold him fast,
So peace may reign, and shadows pass."

"So rest your head, and drift away,
To dreams where hope and heroes play.
For even stars, though vast and grand,
Selenor can't dim the light within your hand."

- It is too late. Cardigan and Selenor find themselves at a ball. It is Scarwall, at first. The undead creations of Zon-Kuthon play such wonderful tunes. The music changes, and so does the locale. The Lady's Light, Zutlieg's domain, is no longer full of lustful pornography, instead, it is now furnished with gnomish whimsy and Erastilian iconography, Zutlieg is singing a most jolly song, full of rhythm and fun. The song is silent. All you can hear is the lullaby. You are both dressed so beautifully. Selenor in a deep midnight black suit, with a shirt of purest white. Cardigan in a deep purple dress, with wide plumage and the most bright blue crystals adorning it, the outfit complements Cardigan's curves and brings out the sharp yellow in Cardigan's eyes. You are in the Sandpoint base now. In the main hall. Gone is the table, moved for the dance.

- On one side: Keleri, Tammerhawk, Korumun, Felaki (alive), Felaki's sister, Bilivar Wheen, Buddy 375, Doctor Buju, Eldariel Eldarielm, Gralcold Hallowbrew, Keppira D’Bear, Idla Lunadream, Jack Frost, Jaella, James Darkmoon, Nalia The Diabolist, Ssalarn The Lesser Silver Dragon, Azrael, Vazron The Imp, Wacky Mole, and Boggly Green.

- On the other side: Aaren d'Cannith, Aarlak, Alissee Tra-Umna, Amar Rookmoon, Drekk Zal, Girro Qedomoro, Junima, Modwinn, Pikk-Pikk, Ra-mei-pasht, Zillif (wearing a strange white coat), Laucian, Verda Sparrow, and Adjo Bohmani.

- There are others.
- They are waiting in the main hall.
- So many friends, they are bursting at the seams to see this.
- So many friends, their laughter turning to the loudest of screams.
- You can't hear them.
- You keep dancing.
- You hear only Cardigan's song as they all melt into the ground, consumed by grey flames.

"Hush little stargazer, close your eyes so brightly,
For in the void's cold cradle; he sleeps hungry nightly.
He, the Devourer, whispers dark and deep,
wait, rest assured, young dreamer, secrets he shall keep."

"Beneath the cosmic tapestry, where stardust softly gleams, 
He slumbers vast and ancient, haunted by lost dreams. 
Though worlds may tremble at his fiery breath, 
And galaxies may shudder at the touch of death."

- You dance on a meteorite, the stars are gone, the planet is gone, the sun, the final star collapses before you, becoming an eye, watching you as it blinks once, twice, thrice, it has blinked out of existence, the dying of the light, the dance never ends.

"So let the void wind whisper of his cosmic might,
And starlight paints his terror on the canvas of the night.
But you, dear child, are safe within your starlit nest,
For dreams hold power greater than the hungering beast."

"Lullaby, lullaby, the Comet doth descend,
But fear not, little sleeper, slumber knows no end.
Stars his hunger weaker, planets in his wake,
Yet dreams like yours; he cannot take."

"So sleep now; little stargazer, let your worries fade,
For even he sleeps, by starlight serenade.
And when you wake, remember, though the void be vast and deep,
Your dreams will guard you always, while the Devourer sleeps."

- As Cardigan's words seem to slip into your mind, they leak into your flesh, ease themselves into your very being, deeper, deeper, into your soul. 
- Deeper. 
- Deeper. 
- Cardigan's words find the door, the gate, the final barrier. 
- The words find themselves in the two halves of Selenor; the halves do not notice or cannot bear to notice. 
- Cardigan's words go beyond the veil, beyond the end. 
- Cardigan's song to Selenor slips into the truth. 
- In the physical world, the runes on Selenor's chest move, shape, and copy themselves upon the tomes that Selenor has absorbed. 
- Upon the tomes are ancient words, carved in the darkest, most oddly colored ink. 
- A list of anathemas and edicts is now written. 
- In a language that only Cardigan and Selenor can understand. 
- As Cardigan finishes singing, Cardigan also falls asleep with Selenor still on her lap. 

## The End.
