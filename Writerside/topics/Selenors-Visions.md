# Selenors-Visions


Pity the covetous, for their wealth will turn to dust;

Pity the righteous, for their words will not be heard;

Pity the wicked, for their deeds will turn into daggers and plunge into their own chests;

They shall be bound with fetters and crushed under the great stones of their own evil.

Fear the heart which is covered by nothingness.

Beware thou mortal things! 
When the gods clash, the sky is red with their lightnings. The hosts of the Devourer and the Black Dominion come forth to do battle, and they smite each other with stars. Turn thou thy face backwards against their gray flame, or thou wilt taste death!

Here is the first rule of necromancy: a necrotic shell is a tool for devouring your foes. 
It doesn’t matter what your intentions are, whenever you command it, it will do what it was made for. Take that shell and put it in the hollow part of your heart, my child. It will serve you well.

Here is the second rule of necromancy: a shell is not subtle. 
It is a naked instrument, hungry for divine sparks. When you grasp its form, treat it as you would a deadly poisonous weapon.

Where are the shades I once knew?

This bright is scorch for my eyes

All I crave is ash - Nameless sentient shell's first words to their creator upon being summoned to the material plane

Listen child, and listen well. For though their skin be scaled about with thickest iron, the fastest way to a monster’s heart is through a mirror of their soul - unknown

The battlefields are treacherous,” said a gorum warrior. “It’s cold, and my back hurts. I fear my poor heart will give out before long. How on earth can I protect it, if not by steel?”

“You can’t,” said the nothing, “A mortal must always wear his heart on the outside


The touch of the necrotic energy  is the deadliest poison known to man. It settles in, deeper than the bone, instantaneously. It is a deep curse that can never be lifted and will last you the rest of your days.


The feeding frenzy of my starving soul, gnawing voraciously at the bones

The exo-skeletal necrotic shell protecting my own reflection within

The twin and same engaged in the mirror act of chewing away at the shell of my attacking self

The paradox of creation and destruction unseen


I have one wish – make of my body a weapon that will fall with great wrath and purpose. Make of my soul a flail that will smash the nihilists of the world. I tire of their existence.- A child of the warden.


Let it never be said that I love life. But to be life, a man must become death. - the Pallid Princess voice


The nothing was the first to teach the undead the ways of violence.

‘Make a fist,’ they said, showing them how, ‘And marry it with your enemy’s jaw


What if my enemy should harm me? asked the undead of the nothing.

Harm them first,” said the nothing, Or else, have a very thick skull

Learn this – child – Learn – the best and truest way of killing. The ghost that tastes without striking, like a snake sampling the air. It sheathes only in flesh, and hides until then, not moving a muscle

I cannot remember my home, said Lorn.

You will forget it out of your mind eventually,  said the nothingness plainly, Every memory of it


Now that you are completely hollow, the voices said to Selenor one day, We can fill you with useful knowledge.


Urgathoa was a mighty noble with powerful soul, born as she was during a storm from the old ages, fully grown and crowned in golden twine.

She was a sorceress noble of some repute and wielded many names of power. She had mastery over secret spells, animals, and deep darkness. Her kingdoms were five and one, prosperous and orderly. She had a court of two hundred varisian warriors, each clad in silvered mail and the equal of any army of earthly men.


Listen, O son/daughter of mine. Strike without understanding, and the blow will bite your hand. Strike with love, and the blow will mangle your arm. But strike with fear, and you might as well hack off your own head


Don’t wake the nothing


The Gods of the World wielded many secret spells, for which there are many terrible and powerful names. None of them save the Pallid Princess were able to wield the bolts with which she smote her foes. It was such a dread power that it was rarely seen in even the ancient ages, and never again after the war for creation, where she herself  vanished


THE SHAPE OF ROYALTY

The very tip of a swallow’s soul as it cuts the air.
The weapon that splits the plum, pit and all.
These are said to resemble Royalty. It is not curved in the slightest. Turn the wheel on its side and you will see its shape. Cut the soul in half and you will see its shape between the two halves. This is its purest expression, in the non-space. 
Observe how it extends forever, and look how it glitters!

The ruling soul must know the lay of their power as the lines on the back of his thumb. They must know it like a path they walk every day, like the house they grew up in. It is a beast they must nurture without fear of being consumed by it, as they surely will be some day if they are not attentive


A bunch of gibberish I wrote out of boredom during my break


If you say his real name, the horrible curse that torments him will surely come true,” she continued. “For this reason, I cannot allow it to pass your lips but a piece at a time. For now, it must suffice to call him ‘nothing’. -D'bear operator role "Mother"

I had a 2h break between classes who I decides to writw some random stuff

“There! – A sun, in the depths,” said the nothing to the gorum warrior.

“The journey is dark and perilous,” said the gorum warrior, “And we have no vessel with which to hold it, neither of clay nor iron.”

“I will devour it,” said the nothing, “And even should my body be consumed by flames, it will at least light our way to the surface.”

In some parts they know the master of the Nothingness as the god of nothing, father of blackholes. In others they know him as the great monster called the Void, who fights with a weapon dipped in molten divine metal. Only one name is bestowed upon him in common across all the wretched cosmos: Devourer.

And there a bloody compact was made, to seek souls in the deep and hollow places of the world. And the blood was mixed and thrown on the fire. Iron was grasped, and sweat was wiped from many a brow, for the road ahead was long, and descended far beyond the grasp and ken of happy men

[01/03/2024 13:36]
Selenor kept with him in his descent a necklace of Pharasma – a gleaming trinket of sorts. This served two excellent purposes: first, when the voices began to tear at Selenor, he would rub it with the pads of his fingers, and it had a wondrous soothing effect.

Second, should Selenor die, the glimmer of the trinket would make finding his body quite easy.

[01/03/2024 13:36]
The Tyrants: unshod and ungirded, they grasped at power, and found themselves burned

[01/03/2024 13:36]
To those who doubt, your wounds will never heal

To those who question my creation – I’m not real.

-Nothing , ‘I am hunger and wrath’

[01/03/2024 13:36]
Do not stare too long at the Void. Do not underestimate the Void, you sorry little fools. It has claws, and it will not hesitate to sink them into your unwilling souls and drag you shrieking into the dark

[01/03/2024 13:36]
Be wary of the children of the warden . Though he has shaped their shells in exchange for their service, their hearts are of cold fire and law, and their bodies are hammers for shattering the nihilists

[01/03/2024 13:36]
The lightn’ings on which they rode were bent with talon’d lash,

An’ few there were that rode ahead and batter’d out their path,

But others reach’d with grasping hands to pluck fools from the fray,

An’ best as known them sorry souls are ridden to this day

[01/03/2024 13:36]
Them that’s young and well and free and yearn to do their part,

is tenth as worse as them that’s old with hunger in their hearts


[06/03/2024 10:50]
The warden on the throne, alone one day,

Took all the emotions from his heart and gave them away,

First came the living children, the first of the gray flame,

Who built him a house, and kept his heart clean

Next came the necro children of bone and cold gray fire,

To seek out all nihilists and add to the pyre.

Then came the creators, the beloved and respected,

The first to lay claim to the Golarion of old.

Last came the gods of deceiving teeth and eyes,

Who swallow all truths and spit out only lies

The third rule of necromancy: learn the ins and outs of the dreaded Necril Speech.

[06/03/2024 12:00]
Illustrious ruler of all shadows

Wield your razors, carve the flesh of man

Control, guide and lead us

Into the nightmare of your wishes fulfilled - an extract from a Zon-Khuton text

Hail the tyrant saint, the great liar.
You will bow before the emperor of the 9 hells. -Nalia reading an extract from a Asmodeus holy text

[06/03/2024 12:00]
Do you understand the true power of a power broker? A simple man must kill with his bare hands. The battered warrior, a weapon. The commander, his bellowing voice, the conspirator, a whispered word. But all these pale compared to kingship. A true power broker need not flex a single muscle in his body, and a hundred men die. A true power broker may murder without a single impulse, or even intent, sight, breath, or even though of his murder. He is an idiot indifferent to his own violence. He has sublimed the act of obliteration.

That is the meaning of kingship

[06/03/2024 12:00]
Let us cut the gods to see if they bleed- nihilist

[06/03/2024 12:00]
Oh killer of stars and splitter of fate, cut us the path with your blade, tempered well in the hot breath of the dying- follower of the Devourer

[06/03/2024 12:00]
He who drinks oceans of souls shall never cease to exist.- a dying soul in the plane of nothing

[06/03/2024 12:00]
Beware the weapon which has no edge

[06/03/2024 12:00]
Selenor was questioned once by his children at their house. The questions were the following:

‘What is the ultimate reason for existence?’

To which Selenor replied, ‘Self-deception.’

‘How can a mortal live in perfect harmony?’

To which Selenor replied, ‘Non-existence.’

‘What is the ultimate result of all action?’

To which Selenor replied, ‘Nothing.’

‘How best can we serve your will?’

To which Selenor replied, ‘Kindly ignore my first three answers and live as you see fit'

[06/03/2024 12:27]
Lives, all mortal lives, expire
Souls go to their dooms, in flame, forever more
Hell, hell, hell has it's laws
Hell, hell, effects and the cause
Curtain falls, but hold your applause
Squirm, squirm, for now down here come the claws
Lives, all mortal lives, expire
Souls go to their dooms, in flame, forever more
Fools, fools, how hard you have fought
Brave, brave, but it's all been for naught
True souls, that couldn't be bought
Doomed, detected, and caught
No more dеals, it's over
The final act, your doom
No more grace, it's over

[07/03/2024 14:52]
I heard a mortal’s heart is worn on their sleeve. Well, it ain’t exactly correct by my reckoning, but close enough. Mortals are easy to read. Their heart shows all up in their eyes and face. It comes out in their breath, their voice, and the slant of their walk. Mortals are living things, beautiful and simple.

Where does Selenor keep his heart then, I wonder? Troubling thoughts, my lads. Troubling thoughts, indeed - Lorn to fellow undead

[07/03/2024 14:52]
Any man who trusts an outsider had better get used to sticking his hand in fires

[07/03/2024 14:52]
My ignorance cast in the mold of all things absolute
I sustain forever my gaze. A stare fixed on the distant oblivion
Resting in the inverted state of being dead, non-sensory matter
As all the earth, the wind, the fire, the sea behold and learn to pity me

[07/03/2024 14:52]
It’s said a mortal should put prudence before power. Well them that says that don’t have power do they? And them that has power don’t have the time to think about prudence. They pull their bloody weapons out and hack away

[07/03/2024 14:52]
A man who kills without thought can cut down the gods

[07/03/2024 14:52]
Yes, she is beautiful. Radiant, even. But make no mistake, our mother is star-kin. She is one of those hungry immortals that peel the flesh from the corpse of heaven, like the starving ghosts from our oldest and most terrifying stories. Our queen is not merciful. Our queen is our eternal slaver, and her whips are ten-thousand miles long- Selenor

From the moment I understood the weakness of mortals, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of the nothing. I aspired to the purity of the blessed necro shell.
Your kind cling to your flesh as if it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass you call a body will wither, and you will beg my kind to save you.
But I am already saved. For the Void is Immortal.- a quote from a whispering way follower

I just realized the whispering way is just the mechanicus but replace machines with undead
