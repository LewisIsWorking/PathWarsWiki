> What happens when a campaign ends?
>> - When a campaign ends I'm going to open up a sandbox mode for players to continue playing in that world with their characters. 
>> - This will be a more relaxed mode of play where players can explore the world, take on side quests, and interact with NPCs without the pressure of a main storyline.

> What campaign will end next?
>> - C06: Kibwe is likely to end next, as we are approaching the conclusion of the main storyline.
>> - Then: C06 -> C05 -> C04 -> C09 -> C07.
