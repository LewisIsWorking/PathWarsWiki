# Classes-of-Golarion

> Overview to changes from the mainline established lore.
>> - Classes are recognised as an official form of specialisation and profession on Golarion such as studying Karate or black-smithing.

## Oracle.

> Changes to the Oracle class.
>> - I like the concept of the oracle being forced into this role by a higher power. 
>> - Instead of being a willing servant their soul is cursed, bound to go to the afterlife plane of their patron deity when they die.
>> - This makes the oracle a tragic figure, forced to serve a deity they may not even like or agree with.
>> - This also opens up the possibility of an oracle trying to break free of their curse, seeking out powerful magic or allies to help them escape their fate.
>> - Additionally, the oracle's powers could be seen as a double-edged sword, granting them great abilities but also marking them to an eternal forced afterlife.
>> - This could lead to interesting role-playing opportunities as the oracle struggles with their identity and the consequences of their powers.
>> - Also while any mythic source can be used to bind & fuel an oracle, the source does not need to reveal themselves to the oracle.
>> - The oracle could be bound to a forgotten or lesser-known deity, or even a powerful spirit or force of nature as long as they are power level mythical or above.
>> - This could lead to interesting storylines as the oracle seeks to uncover the true nature of their patron and the reasons behind their curse.
