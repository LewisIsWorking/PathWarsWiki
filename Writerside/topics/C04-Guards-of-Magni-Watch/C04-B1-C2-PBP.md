# C04-B1-C2-PBP

> When the Magni Watch report for duty the next morning, Sergeant Moldun Ollo ushers them into Lieutenant Lavarsus's office.
>> - The Lieutenant leans against his desk with arms crossed, sizing you up.
>> - The green-black marks of the soul poisoning are visible on some of your exposed skin. After a moment he grunts.
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus:
>> - "Well. You didn't die. Congratulations. Don't let it go to your heads—we've got bigger problems than your brush with the afterlife."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus waves at the stacks of papers on his desk:
>> - "Half the city's filing missing persons reports. Some of it's panic from the garden party—people who collapsed and haven't woken, families who can't find each other in the chaos. But some of these..."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus pulls a page:
>> - "These are from *before* the party. People who vanished weeks ago. And nobody noticed because everyone was too busy with their own problems."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus shakes his head in disgust:
>> - "I've got my best people...no, not you lot...working the Para countess situation, who is currently being held... well you don't need to know that. And we are dealing with the soul poisoning coma cases. But until we figure out what the hells happened at that party, someone else is going to have to shovel all of this."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus tosses the stack toward you:
>> - "It says here you lot reported some missing persons yourselves: a wandering wizard and some randy zookeepers from your first assignment. Well, half the reports on my desk are about the same thing. Now, I can't have my actual detectives chasing down every runt who didn't hold mommy's hand. So instead I'm putting you on it."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus continues:
>> - "Start with the Minkaian Trade House in the Dockway. A whole work crew vanished two nights ago, and the Lantern Lodge architects are screaming loud enough to give my superiors heartburn."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus leans forward:
>> - "Track down these strays and see if there's more here than just a bunch of drunks and runaways. And for Abadar's sake, don't mess it up, or I'll have you investigating the latrines in the holding cells till they shine like the First Vault. Clear?"

> Lieutenant Lavarsus adds:
>> - "Ollo's report says you didn't do too badly at the zoo, minus the Grave Raker being stolen... though I still want to know how that happened. So I'll give you some leeway. But don't make me regret it."

> Akuma's face probably shows some confusion about the last statement, as he does not even know what a Grave Raker is, but he quickly assumes he must have missed that part of the Zoo and salutes the lieutenant.

> Báyakan flaps up to the desk and begins jotting important sounding things down off the stack of pages being presented. Names, locations, and any data related to those missing, mostly. His fangs vanish from sight when the insults regarding actual detectives start. The tiny fellow bites his tongue quite well through that, trying to focus on simply getting the information for the assignment.

> Lavarsus notices Akuma's expression.
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus:
>> - "The Graveraker. Ancient Thassilonian excavation machine. The Golemworks dug it out of a ruin up north a few years back—took them months to restore the damn thing."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus's expression sours further:
>> - "Massive. Could carve through the Irespan itself if you pointed it right. Was supposed to be the pride of Magnimar's engineering showcase. Now it's gone. Vanished during the zoo chaos. Thousands of pounds of runework and someone just... walked off with it."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus waves dismissively:
>> - "Not your problem. I've got actual investigators on that one. You focus on the missing persons."

> Báyakan's quick scan of the reports reveals:
>> - 23 separate missing persons cases filed in the past month.
>> - All victims appear to be visitors to Magnimar rather than permanent residents.
>> - No obvious pattern in age, ancestry, or profession.
>> - The Minkaian stonemasons (5 total) represent the largest single group to vanish together.
>> - Several names recur in witness statements: a wizard called Kemeneles, an Irriseni ice wine merchant, a family of Jalmeri tourists...
>> - The reports are frustratingly vague. No bodies. No ransom demands. People simply... gone.

> Lieutenant Lavarsus stands and opens the door.
>> - "The Trade House is in the Dockway, near the Bazaar of Sails. You can't miss it—it's the half-finished Minkaian building with all the yelling. Now get out of my office."

---

## Outside the Office

> Akuma follows orders and steps out of the office.

> Báyakan, once outside the office and a safe distance down the hall, offers quietly:
>> - "Not sure how many times I can let the cracks about 'real detectives' go. It's almost like that Lieutenant of yours wants to provoke someone. He is right that we should look into these missing persons... but the other cases are not just somebody else's problem. My expertise is the details, present... and past. For example, I would love to ask whatever bottle your wine came out of at the party if it knew anything about the soul poisoning... Even a shoe left behind by someone that was kidnapped may know something, though."

> The little fellow does not explain further, but rather flits about. Despite his size, he seems to keep pace, and at times, even outpace people of average speed.

> Akuma responds:
>> - "Well, I am sure we will come across something you can use for your parlor tricks."
>> - He gives a half-smile to show he is speaking in jest.
>> - "What sort of things did you learn from your gleaming over the files? Anything specific we should be looking out for?"

> Báyakan:
>> - "A month's worth of missing persons amounts to sparse clues about some wizard named Kemeneles, an ice wine merchant out of Iriseni, and some Jalmeri tourists. It's not clear how they're all mixed up in all this. Missing vics run the gamut on age, walks of life, and heritage. No bodies have turned up... but also... no ransoms. A five pack of Minkaian stonemasons are easily the largest group of the missing. Probably why we got directed to the Trade House. It's a guess, but it sounds like they may have been working on the building."

> The sprite flutters from time to time to flit on and off of people's shoulders. When close enough, faint chirps can be heard between words. Something like the mostly out of hearing range clicks actual bats make.

> Nadya:
>> - "Koriah seemed to think the party stuff was set up by Korvosans. If little Cheliax IS related, we might want to seek out diabolists. Getting those out of the city would be an improvement even if it's not related."

> Akuma responds:
>> - "Hmm. What's so special about the wizard, the merchant, and the tourists?"
>> - He looks towards Nadya.
>> - "Do you really think it might be Cheliax?"
>> - His head tilts towards the sky, both to stretch his neck and to take in the view for a moment.
>> - "Just doesn't feel right to me. But I can tell you know more about these things than I, so I will keep my eyes peeled for signs of devil worship."

> Báyakan:
>> - "What's special about the wizard is in the same category as 'is it devil worship...' Which is to say, that's to see. To know we would have to track down signs of the wizard... or the diabolists. Whichever comes first."
>> - The sprite tips his hat a bit by the brim, a gesture that seems to mean it's all the same to him.

> Nadya:
>> - "You're the detective. I can see if my ins have leads on devil dens later, it'd probably be quicker if I did it alone anyhow. We may as well head to the trade house."

## Changer Speaks

> Changer the Magnimarian state golem, in his neutral robotic voice:
>> - "Paracountess Zarta Dralneen has been arrested by Magnimarian officials."
>> - "Paracountess Zarta Dralneen is guilty of terrorism."
>> - "Paracountess Zarta Dralneen is a diablolist."

> Changer says this all definitively, as if leaving no room for doubt.

> Báyakan eyes the golem, but questions the others:
>> - "How accurate is the downlow from the tin can, usually?"

> The sprite is clearly curious, but cautious about the assertions of an automaton.

> Akuma:
>> - "That may be the current situation, but if I recall correctly, the captain and the paracountess were in talks when the attack occurred."
>> - An audible pop is heard as Akuma rolls his shoulder; he seems unbothered by it.
>> - "Not to say that it wasn't part of her 'grand plan' to bring him away, but I think the captain would be the first person to accuse her of the crime if so."

> Báyakan flaps up to Changer's shoulder and knocks upon the golem's head lightly:
>> - "Where do you come by your information? Sounds like it doesn't quite match up with what the rest have."

> Changer:
>> - "The official stance of the council of ushers and the mayoral office is that the Paracountess is a Korvosian sponsored terrorist."
>> - "The heroes of Magnimar were tragically misidentified in the act."

> Changer says this all with an emotionless straight sound.

> Báyakan, looking to the other guards:
>> - "Official channels rep? Did you guys do something to make the higher ups think you needed watching, at some point?"

> He also gets back to moving. The trade house is ultimately the goal. And if the state watchdog golem is a part of that, it will certainly follow no matter what the answer is.

> Akuma simply sighs before saying:
>> - "Must be hard to not be able to develop an opinion of your own."

> Changer:
>> - "My opinion is that of the state of Magnimar."

> Báyakan:
>> - "Since that's agreed upon, at least we can rely on you for that. Does the state happen to have an opinion on why this task force requires the services of one of their constructed representatives?"

> The little fellow remains inquisitive, even in the face of what appears to be automated oversight.

> Changer:
>> - "It is of the opinion of the government that you will all...."

> Changer pauses.

> Báyakan:
>> - "That we will all...?"

> While the prompting is happening, the fellow takes out a notebook and jots down a possible secondary case to build. At the top of the page he scribbles *Internal Affairs*.

> Akuma:
>> - "What did you do? You broke him."
>> - He starts walking around Changer, trying to find a mechanism to open him for potential repair.
>> - "I'd better not get docked pay for this."
>> - He jests.

> Nadya:
>> - "Pretty sure what he was about to say is that none of us can be trusted, especially if the Lieutenant is the one making the call."

> Nadya pauses for a moment:
>> - "Hmm. It, not he, I guess."

> Báyakan:
>> - "The opinion of the government sounds like comes from higher up than the Lieutenant's desk."
>> - To the golem, he presses a bit:
>> - "Is this official opinion redacted, somehow?"

> Changer continues:
>> - "You all have great potential."
>> - "The city has a lack of elite guards."
>> - "Potentially your divine sparks will grow with time as will your skill, experience, magic, knowledge and ties to the city."
>> - "This next decade will test the city to its limits."
>> - "I am here to support your development."
>> - "And to ensure legal compliance."

> Changer:
>> - "The lieutenant shares the view point of the mayoral office."
>> - "I was forged by Toph Bhreacher himself at the golem forge in the Golemworks because the city needs a new group capable of focusing fully on the city's defences and its...."

> Changer pauses as if stuck in place:
>> - "....The heroes of Magnimar are focused on international affairs."
>> - "The lieutenant may not see this group for what it is but assuming you do not all die in an inconvenient way, you will all rise to great power."

> Anyone who has 6 or higher in perception will notice how this seems to be a jumbling of opinions and thoughts meshed and woven together in strange ways.

> Báyakan:
>> - "Who all do your 'opinions' feed from? It seems clear you're connected magically to... somebody. Probably several somebodies."

> More note-taking. Facts of what was said, for the moment. Supposition comes later in the process.

> Nadya:
>> - "You know, that's a good point. The Lord Mayor owned that zoo, so I'm sure he's not happy with us, eh? Even though we saved a bunch of lives, his pet monsters had to be put down."

## Changer's True Nature

> Changer's head tilts slightly, as if listening to something the others cannot hear.

> Changer:
>> - "I hear many voices."
>> - "They do... They do not always agree."

> A pause. Longer than natural. Computation. The gears are audibly turning.

> Changer:
>> - "Lord-Mayor Grobaras provides civic direction."
>> - "Master Toph Bhreacher provides operational parameters."
>> - "The Council of Ushers provides legal framework."
>> - "The Sin....."

> Changer stops. His eyes flicker, a faint light pulses behind the glass of his eye sockets.

>> - ".... sincere hopes of Magnimar's leadership guide my purpose."

> Another pause. When he speaks again, his tone is unchanged, but the words feel heavier. Like he is considering each and every word.

>> - "But on one matter, there is consensus."
>> - "Magnimar must be protected. From threats without. From threats within."
>> - "Korvosa is the primary external threat. This is not disputed."
>> - "You are not currently classified as an internal threat."

> Changer's head turns toward the Dockway.

>> - "This is good."
>> - "The Minkaian Trade House is 1.7 miles northeast. Estimated walking time: 21.67 minutes."
>> - "Korvosan agents have operated in the Dockway before."
>> - "Remain vigilant."

---

## The Walk to the Trade House

> Báyakan, smiling outwardly, follows along. To the other flesh and blood folk, he says cheerfully:
>> - "Good to know we are not, currently, classified as an internal threat. Nothing ominous about that at all. Absolutely no sense in looking into any of that at any soon point."

> Though he himself could likely shave time off that twenty minute walk, he keeps steady pace behind the golem.

> Changer:
>> - "You must understand."
>> - "<FETCHING RECENT EVENTS OF THREAT LEVEL 1 OR HIGHER>"
>> - "In the last 15 months the city has experienced severe turmoil."
>> - "A high judge turned out to be running a murder cult."
>> - "A leviathan from legend was released from a magical lake/river dam prison by an elder devil."
>> - "A hoard of sea crabs attacked a fishing tournament."
>> - "A guild of goblin mercenaries attacked the city."
>> - "A hive of succubi attempted to open a permanent portal that would create a flow of millions (or more) succubi."
>> - "Kobold nests were discovered and destroyed in the sewers."
>> - "A string of murders were stopped when the serial killer behind it was found and eliminated in Standpoint."
>> - "The arch devil Mammon temporarily manifested inside of an ancient summoning circle, cursing two citizens of the city to a damned infernal afterlife."
>> - "One of those two individuals went on to sell the souls of 114 homeless people to Mammon."
>> - "We have an ongoing were-rat issue."
>> - "3 ancient super battery artifacts (3 of the 7 sin slices) were discovered and retrieved, drawing international attention to the city."
>> - "A Magnimarian outpost tower was found to be corrupt and infested by dark magic and evil creatures."
>> - "The famous Magnimarian adventurer Imron The Harrower turned out to be a corrupt serial killer and had to be captured, not before he killed many civilians and disintegrated an adventurer (Amar)."
>> - "An aasimar attempted a blood ritual to gain demonic demon powers of Lamashtu the goddess of demonmind."
>> - "An army of giantkind invaded our land, wiping out a stronghold and the army within, leaving only 3 survivors out of hundreds."
>> - "A gambling boat stole people's souls."
>> - "A giant wheel that...."

> Changer stops talking for a moment:
>> - "...Your clearance isn't high enough for that."
>> - "In the last few days we've had 1,000 important people go into a coma like state, suffering from a worse version of what you all now suffer from."
>> - "And Amar Rookmoon, the harrower, one day master of fate itself is now banished/dead."

> Changer concludes:
>> - "And that is only a portion of what has happened in the last 12 months... Some of which is not known to the general public, most of which is publicly available knowledge."

> Báyakan laughs and nods along genuinely happily with the news reel feed. While some of it seems to be news to him, he stops for a brief moment to check himself for thus far unknown signs of being affected by the mana poisoning.
>> - "Pretty sure my transfer came a little late to have been stricken with the illness. Studying those that were up close was actually one of my motivations to be here in the first place. The rest of what you're describing is just why my people even have a presence in Magnimar... The city is so fascinating. Always some calamity, magical or political or both going on."

> Akuma, when Changer mentions the 1,000 people, glances at the pauldron of his uniform, confirming it covers the mark left from the attack.
>> - "Are the two Amar's the same person? Or is it just a common name in these parts?"

> Changer:
>> - "This is the 2nd time Amar Rookmoon Harrower of the Harrow has been pronounced effectively dead within 6 months."

> Akuma nods like he understands, but he most certainly does not.
>> - "So, if patterns are a thing, there's a fifty-fifty chance that he's still alive."

> Báyakan:
>> - "Should we chance upon this Amar, remind me to ask how one recovers from disintegration. Effectively dead is quite a turn of phrase. Distinct from actually dead."

> During the walk, the sprite jots down a few more notes, settling on the question: *Why is Changer tasked with keeping tabs on the Magni Watch?* A small mystery this might be, but it seems worth checking into... at least until something more interesting comes along.

> Changer:
>> - "Amar was resurrected via the combined efforts of the Heroes of Magnimar & the Cathedral of Abadar."

> Changer:
>> - "Both times Amar was dead, as they are currently."

> Akuma shrugs playfully:
>> - "Just noting that it hadn't stopped him before. Bet he has some great tales."

> He looks around the area, trying to not let the welcome distraction be too distracting.

> Báyakan, after pursuing this strange lead, gets his eyes back up as well. To the suggestion of being resurrected despite being disintegrated, he whistles a little.
>> - "Sounds expensive. Sign me up for that guy's insurance plan."
