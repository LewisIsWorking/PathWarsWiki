> When the Magni Watch report for duty the next morning, Sergeant Moldun Ollo ushers them into Lieutenant Lavarsus's office.
>> - The Lieutenant leans against his desk with arms crossed, sizing you up.
>> - The green-black marks of the soul poisoning are visible on some of your exposed skin. After a moment he grunts.
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus:
>> - "Well. You didn't die. Congratulations. Don't let it go to your heads—we've got bigger problems than your brush with the afterlife."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus waves at the stacks of papers on his desk:
>> - "Half the city's filing missing persons reports. Some of it's panic from the garden party—people who collapsed and haven't woken, families who can't find each other in the chaos. But some of these..."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus pulls a page:
>> - "These are from *before* the party. People who vanished weeks ago. And nobody noticed because everyone was too busy with their own problems."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus shakes his head in disgust:
>> - "I've got my best people...no, not you lot...working the Para countess situation, who is currently being held... well you don't need to know that. And we are dealing with the soul poisoning coma cases. But until we figure out what the hells happened at that party, someone else is going to have to shovel all of this."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus tosses the stack toward you:
>> - "It says here you lot reported some missing persons yourselves: a wandering wizard and some randy zookeepers from your first assignment. Well, half the reports on my desk are about the same thing. Now, I can't have my actual detectives chasing down every runt who didn't hold mommy's hand. So instead I'm putting you on it."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus continues:
>> - "Start with the Minkaian Trade House in the Dockway. A whole work crew vanished two nights ago, and the Lantern Lodge architects are screaming loud enough to give my superiors heartburn."
>> - Lieutenant Lavarsus leans forward:
>> - "Track down these strays and see if there's more here than just a bunch of drunks and runaways. And for Abadar's sake, don't mess it up, or I'll have you investigating the latrines in the holding cells till they shine like the First Vault. Clear?"

> Lieutenant Lavarsus adds:
>> - "Ollo's report says you didn't do too badly at the zoo, minus the Grave Raker being stolen... though I still want to know how that happened. So I'll give you some leeway. But don't make me regret it."
