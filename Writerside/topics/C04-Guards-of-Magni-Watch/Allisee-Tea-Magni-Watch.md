# Allisee-Tea-Magni-Watch
James Dark-Moon seems satisfied that you are all ready.
And a carriage takes the group up the seacleft cliff.
Across the city.
And to the Alabaster district.
The Magni Watch arrive at a large manor house, the house is black and red in colour.
It is regal yet daunting.
The sounds of music is heard.
Classical music, a string quartet.
LOTS of people are going back and forth through the garden path around the manor.
You follow James Dark-Moon.
There are hundreds of people here.
All wearing lavish dresses and crisp suits.
Long tables stretch across the garden.

Each table is covered in a blood-red silken tablecloth.
Atop each table is far more expensive food and wine than any of you could consume over several days.
James Dark Moon gives you patrol areas, gives you instructions on when to check in and general advice and information.
As the night starts to really begin and even more people arrive, you see a familiar face: Viole of the Heroes of Magnimar!
And alongside Viole are the other Heroes of Magnimar.
Does anyone approach the heroes?
If not, I'll be progressing the story now.

You are all busy with guard duty so we can have the conversations (if any) retroactively.
@Linksanelf2006
Akuma.

As you patrol the grounds of the mansion, you hear the sounds of Tian Xia string music.

You are reminded of home.

Of Ba-Ming.

Of....

The illusion is broken, you snap back into reality.
Near your foot, just poking out of a bush is a rat.

The rat looks at you Akuma, the scurries into the bush.
Meanwhile...
For 2 hours, the heroes of Magnimar seem to be looking around the grounds, doing a variety of magical channeling and searching.
They receive a few strange looks.
For 3 hours after that, the hero you recognise as Allisee is brewing something called "Unity Tea".
You are each passed a cup.
This woman approaches you.
Paracountess Zarta Dralneen:
"Welcome, welcome to my estate.

I am Paracountess Zarta Dralneen."

Paracountess Zarta Dralneen then courtesies.
Paracountess Zarta Dralneen insists you all try the unity tea and James Dark-Moon cautiously agrees.
James Dark-Moon:
"The Paracountress and I have some items of business to discuss, continue your guard."
James Dark-Moon goes off with the Paracountess.
As you all enjoy your tea and continue your guard, nothing much happens...for a bit.
@ArtyArtillery

Nadya
Nadya, you see Allisee and man walk off.
The man is covered in thick padded leather.
...and nothing happens for about 20 minutes.
Time stop at 10th level is cast.
The Magni Watch do not realise it but events are happening beyond what they witness.
Time unfreezes.
The heroes of Magnimar stand, a little out of breath and visibly injured.
There are piles of ash and a couple of strange gemstones laying in the ash.
In this garden is a bronze orb thing.
It's a decoration.
You would never really pay much attention to it.
It glows and everyone, *everyone* at the party becomes stunned.
Even the protector Magnimar Jyronn Immikar and the great mages of the Golemworks, they are all stunned.
@Linksanelf2006

Akuma is frozen, but you feel no pain and suffer no adverse effects.
Around 1,000 people collapse.
Black and green veins spread across people's bodies; they twist and contort on the ground.
This includes the members of the Magni Watch.
@HistoricallyInaccurate

Zilde Even-Guard.

Your eyes are closing, your life as you know it, fading.

You see a figure sprinting towards you, his black hair catches the light of the moon, he is screaming, but your hearing has already stopped working.
@HistoricallyInaccurate

You can make our parts of his yelling:

"Won't", "Again", "Please."
@Askarans

The poison hurts Machiq particularly; it is not clear why.
Changer is not moving; the stone of his body glows intensely as if trying to absorb the energies of this magic, but just being completely unable to do so.
@Linksanelf2006

Akuma, like I said, you are not overly affected by whatever is happening.

You see James Dark-Moon run up to Zilde Even-Guard, genuinely scared.

He prays, channelling magic and something happens.
The only person deeply injured was Allisee, she stands, blood dripping, flesh broken.
Viole comes over to James Dark-Moon, the two of them cast something on the Magni Watch.
The party pass out, but none of you are dead.
- The next day -
