# Allisee-Tea-Magni-Watch

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:17]
James Dark-Moon seems satisfied that you are all ready.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:17]
And a carriage takes the group up the seacleft cliff.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:17]
Across the city.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:17]
And to the Alabaster district.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:18]
The Magni Watch arrive at a large manor house, the house is black and red in colour.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:26]
It is regal yet daunting.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:26]
The sounds of music is heard.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:27]
Classical music, a string quartet.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:27]
LOTS of people are going back and forth through the garden path around the manor.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:27]
You follow James Dark-Moon.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 18:59]
There are hundreds of people here.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 18:59]
All wearing lavish dresses and crisp suits.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:00]
Long tables stretch across the garden.

Each table is covered in a blood-red silken tablecloth.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:01]
Atop each table is far more expensive food and wine than any of you could consume over several days.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:02]
James Dark Moon gives you patrol areas, gives you instructions on when to check in and general advice and information.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:03]
As the night starts to really begin and even more people arrive, you see a familiar face: Viole of the Heroes of Magnimar!

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:05]
And alongside Viole are the other Heroes of Magnimar.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:06]
Does anyone approach the heroes?

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:06]
If not, I'll be progressing the story now.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:10]
You are all busy with guard duty so we can have the conversations (if any) retroactively.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:43]
@Linksanelf2006
Akuma.

As you patrol the grounds of the mansion, you hear the sounds of Tian Xia string music.

You are reminded of home.

Of Ba-Ming.

Of....

The illusion is broken, you snap back into reality.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:43]
Near your foot, just poking out of a bush is a rat.

The rat looks at you Akuma, the scurries into the bush.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:46]
Meanwhile...

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:47]
For 2 hours, the heroes of Magnimar seem to be looking around the grounds, doing a variety of magical channeling and searching.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:48]
They receive a few strange looks.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:50]
For 3 hours after that, the hero you recognise as Allisee is brewing something called "Unity Tea".

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:50]
You are each passed a cup.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:53]


Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:54]
This woman approaches you.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:39]
Paracountess Zarta Dralneen:
"Welcome, welcome to my estate.

I am Paracountess Zarta Dralneen."

Paracountess Zarta Dralneen then courtesies.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:39]
Paracountess Zarta Dralneen insists you all try the unity tea and James Dark-Moon cautiously agrees.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:40]
James Dark-Moon:
"The Paracountress and I have some items of business to discuss, continue your guard."

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:42]
James Dark-Moon goes off with the Paracountess.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:43]
As you all enjoy your tea and continue your guard, nothing much happens...for a bit.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:44]
@ArtyArtillery

Nadya

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:45]
Nadya, you see Allisee and man walk off.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:45]


Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:47]
The man is covered in thick padded leather.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:47]
...and nothing happens for about 20 minutes.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:48]
Time stop at 10th level is cast.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:48]
The Magni Watch do not realise it but events are happening beyond what they witness.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:49]
Time unfreezes.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:50]
The heroes of Magnimar stand, a little out of breath and visibly injured.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:51]
There are piles of ash and a couple of strange gemstones laying in the ash.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:53]
In this garden is a bronze orb thing.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:53]
It's a decoration.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:53]
You would never really pay much attention to it.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:55]
It glows and everyone, *everyone* at the party becomes stunned.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:55]
Even the protector Magnimar Jyronn Immikar and the great mages of the Golemworks, they are all stunned.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:56]
@Linksanelf2006

Akuma is frozen, but you feel no pain and suffer no adverse effects.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:57]
Around 1,000 people collapse.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:57]
Black and green veins spread across people's bodies; they twist and contort on the ground.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:58]
This includes the members of the Magni Watch.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:00]
@HistoricallyInaccurate

Zilde Even-Guard.

Your eyes are closing, your life as you know it, fading.

You see a figure sprinting towards you, his black hair catches the light of the moon, he is screaming, but your hearing has already stopped working.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:01]
@HistoricallyInaccurate

You can make our parts of his yelling:

"Won't", "Again", "Please."

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:02]
@Askarans

The poison hurts Machiq particularly; it is not clear why.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:03]
Changer is not moving; the stone of his body glows intensely as if trying to absorb the energies of this magic, but just being completely unable to do so.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:13]
@Linksanelf2006

Akuma, like I said, you are not overly affected by whatever is happening.

You see James Dark-Moon run up to Zilde Even-Guard, genuinely scared.

He prays, channelling magic and something happens.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:16]
The only person deeply injured was Allisee, she stands, blood dripping, flesh broken.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:17]


Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:41]
Viole comes over to James Dark-Moon, the two of them cast something on the Magni Watch.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:41]
The party pass out, but none of you are dead.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:42]
- The next day -
