- There a drow bard, Tony Sparks rips out his heart and grabs a piece of crystal from his own chest.
- The heart becomes a dark blue crystal heart.
- Selenor is told he can retcon one event from session 1 to session 228.
- Selenor considers fixing Cardigan's mind but does the right thing and stops the Horsemen's invasions of the material planes.
- Selenor's choice does several things:

1. A deal is forged between Death and Asmodeus.
2. The plane of Tallinn Garden is released from hell and becomes archives by the watchers.
3. Selenor must take over the now archived plane of Tallinn Garden.
4. Selenor must also deactivate a daemonic artifact in Tallinn Garden.

- Tallinn Garden is worshipped by a God called the First.
- The First is the God of Truth.

If Selenor does not do these things, he will be hunted down and killed by Hell Knights.

Selenor retroactively signed this contract during the events of Crimson Throne in 4709 AR.

Selenor also gained the Chronicler lore abilities.
