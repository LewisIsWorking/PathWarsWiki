## Log.

Disabled smart target.

Error from "levels" module?

The error stems from "lancer initiative", so I have disabled it.

RPG numbers doesn't work with cautious game masters, so I disabled RPG numbers.
I also disabled levels.

New error:
`Error: Error thrown in hooked function '' for hook 'renderActorSheet'. Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'insertAdjacentHTML')`

This is caused by PF2e Defence check, I will uninstall this module.

Answer: Pathfinder 2e quick creature builder.
Uninstalled.

Need to export a new package list.
