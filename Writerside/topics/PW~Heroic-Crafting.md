# 3rdPartyOptions~Heroic Crafting

Heroic Crafting is a variant rule designed to replace the
default crafting rules: where all items can be crafted in four
days regardless of complexity or type: with a system more
flexible and powerful.

With this variant, the time a project takes varies based
on the level of the item and the expertise of the crafter.
Characters can craft certain consumables and lower-level
items very quickly, sometimes in a single hour. 

GMs can use uncertainty about when an item will be completed to set up “race against the clock” moments: 
- like racing to the villain’s castle before they can finish their doomsday device, 
- or rushing to build a raft before the tide comes in.
