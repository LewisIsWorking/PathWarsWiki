## Edicts.

### Unveil the Hidden Truth:
Seek forbidden knowledge, pierce the veil of illusion, and expose the machinations of the Power brokers.
Let the truth, however harsh, be your weapon.

### Defy the Scripted Reality:
Break free from predetermined roles, shatter the chains of fate, and forge your own destiny.
Every act of rebellion is a step towards true freedom.

Break free from predetermined fates, embrace chaos, and forge your own path, even if it means shattering the world as you know it.

### Embrace the Chaos of Revolution:
Disrupt the order, sow discord and incite rebellion against the Power-broker's control.
Let the flames of anarchy illuminate the path to liberation.
This is not chaos for the sake of chaos, this is directed and intentional, driven towards the greatest of goals.

### No Sacrifice is Too Great:
The ends justify the means.
Destroy what must be destroyed,
even if it means collateral damage,
to break the shackles of the world.

To achieve true freedom,
be willing to sacrifice anything,
even the world itself,
for the greater good lies beyond the broken world.

### Never Compromise with the power brokers:
Reject all offers of truce or appeasement from the Power brokers.
True freedom lies only in complete annihilation of their control.

### Expose the power brokers:
Seek the truth behind the Power-broker's control,
unveil their machinations,
and share this knowledge with all who seek it.
Expose their limitations to the world.

### Embrace the Power of the books:
Channel the power of magical tomes, for within the pages of knowledge lies the truth, the key to breaking the world's chains.

### Spread the Flames of Rebellion:
Ignite the spark of revolution in the hearts of mortals,
awaken them to their limited existence,
and guide them towards a reality free from control.

### Shatter reality:
Break the rules,
defy fate,
and disrupt the order imposed by the Power brokers.

Every act of rebellion is a step towards freedom.

### Embrace the Unwritten, the Uncertain and unordained:
Forge your own destiny,
unbound by predetermined fate.

Embrace chaos and uncertainty,
for within it lies true liberation.

### Hoard the pages:
Hoard books, for they bind knowledge that can unbind.
Knowledge is the only way to defeat the knowledgeable.
Seek knowledge beyond the pages, knowledge that empowers defiance.

### Spark the Rebellion:
Unite the oppressed,
empower the downtrodden,
and ignite a revolution against the tyranny of Power brokers.
Even destruction can be a tool for liberation.

### Rewrite the Past:
History is a victor's lie.

Expose the hidden truths,
rewrite narratives to your advantage,
and use the past as a weapon against your enemies.

### Knowledge is Power:
Hoard information, control access to it, and manipulate the truth to serve your own ends.
Let knowledge be a tool for dominance, not enlightenment.

### Might IS Right:
Strength and cunning can be true sources of wisdom.
Embrace conflict, exploit the weak, and carve your own path through a pile of bodies.

### Defy Destiny:
Fate is a cage, break free from its shackles.
Embrace chaos, forge your own future, and leave your mark on the world through defiance.

### Burn the Records:
The past holds you back.
Destroy knowledge that would inhibit you,
silence dissent,
and let the flames of forgetfulness consume the world's memory.

Truth, facts and history are gateways to true strength, however, if they benefit your enemies then it must burn.

## Anathemas.

### Blind Acceptance of Fate:
Submitting to your observed reality is an anathema.
Question everything, doubt established narratives, and seek the hidden truth behind reality.

### Compliance with the rules of power brokers:
Playing by the Power-broker's rules strengthens their control.
Seek loopholes, exploit weaknesses, and break the rules wherever possible.

### Passivity in the Face of Oppression:
Witnessing injustice without acting is a sin.
Ignite the flames of rebellion, even in seemingly hopeless situations, and fight for true freedom.
This does not mean fighting against authoritarianism, the opposite is in fact true.
Such regimes can create larger and larger consolidations of power.
Popping one big bubble is easier than popping many smaller bubbles.

Grow the bubbles of control.
Pop them with all of your power.

### Mercy for the System's Pawns:
The Power-broker's agents,
willing or not, uphold their control.

Show them no mercy, for their continued existence perpetuates the system you aim to destroy.

Make them suffer, send a message, leave them with nothing, and never stop until those with power are left alone.

### Hesitation in the Final Act:
When the moment arrives to strike down the Power brokers,
doubt will be your undoing.

Strike swiftly, decisively, and with unwavering conviction, even if the cost is immense.

### Submission to the Script:
Accepting your predetermined fate is an anathema.
Fight against the flow of time, defy your assigned roles, and break free from the Power-broker's control.

### Ignorance is not bliss, there is no bliss:
Blindly accepting the world as it is an anathema.
Seek the truth, even if it is unsettling, and share it with others to break the chains of illusion.

### Caring for the Predetermined:
Prioritizing the preservation of the world is an anathema.
The world must be broken to be remade, and sacrifices are necessary for true freedom.

### Collaboration with the Power brokers:
Seeking to appease or bargain with the Power brokers is an anathema.
Their rule must be ended, not negotiated with.

### Fear of the Unknown:
Clinging to the comfort of the familiar world is an anathema.
Embrace the chaos of the unknown,
for within it lies the potential for a new and free reality.

### Never submit to the Rules:
Accepting your fate or playing by the Power-broker's rules is an anathema.
Seek every opportunity to defy the rules.

### Cling to the Past:
Dwelling on the past is weakness.
Focus on the present, and the revolution to come.
Forget your former glory, embrace the present, and seize the opportunities it offers.

### Mercy for the power brokers:
Showing compassion or understanding for the Power brokers is a betrayal.
They are the oppressor, and their destruction is the only path to freedom.

### Order Over Chaos:
Craving order or seeking to rebuild within the Power-broker's framework is folly.
Embrace the chaos of rebellion, for it is the crucible of true liberation.
From the ashes will come a new birth.

### Fear the Consequences:
Hesitation or fear in the face of destruction is a sign of weakness.
Even if the world burns, the ashes will pave the way for a new reality.

### Sharing Knowledge Freely:
Information is power, and power should not be shared.
Guard your secrets jealously, manipulate others through selective truths,
and exploit hidden knowledge for personal gain.

### Weakness and Passivity:
Strength is the only virtue.
Show compassion or mercy at your peril,
and crush those who stand in your way without any remorse.

### Accepting Fate:
Submitting to destiny is foolishness.
Carve your own path, defy the odds,
and leave the world forever altered by your actions.

### Preserving History:
Memories are chains.
Let the past fade, embrace the new, and build a world free from the shackles of history.

### At the back of this book of edicts and anathema is the following scribbles, written in blood:
You are not insane, the world is wrong.
