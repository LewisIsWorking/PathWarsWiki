# The Duergar of PW-Golarion

The duergar, known as grey dwarves, are among the most ruthless and technologically advanced denizens of Golarion's Darklands. 

These ash-skinned descendants of surface dwarves have evolved into something far more sinister in the depths below.

## Physical Characteristics & Culture

Duergar possesses pale grey to charcoal skin, stark white or silver hair, and cold, calculating eyes that reflect their harsh underground existence. 

Both sexes are typically bald or keep their hair severely cropped, adorning themselves with intricate piercings and brands that denote rank, achievement or ownership status within their rigid caste system.

Their society operates on principles of absolute dominance and technological superiority. 

Duergar cities are marvels of dark engineering: towering spires of black iron and enchanted stone, powered by enslaved elementals and fed by the suffering of countless thralls. 

Steam-powered machinery and clockwork automatons serve alongside broken-willed slaves in their foundries and workshops.

## Abilities & Technology

Beyond their natural dwarven resilience, duergar possess inherent psionic abilities allowing them to enlarge themselves to giant proportions or turn invisible at will. 

Their most feared warriors can grow to twice normal size mid-combat, wielding massive weapons with devastating effect.

Their technological prowess manifests in sophisticated clockwork constructs, alchemical weapons that emit choking gases, and elaborate torture devices that serve both practical and recreational purposes. 

Duergar artificers craft items that blend arcane magic with mechanical precision: 
crossbows that fire multiple bolts simultaneously, armour that enhances their psionic abilities, and vehicles that traverse the treacherous Darklands terrain.

## Role in Darklands Society

The duergar control vast slave-trading networks throughout the Darklands, dealing in surface dwellers, other Darklands races, and even demons when profitable. 

Their fortress-cities serve as hubs of commerce and cruelty, where flesh markets operate alongside weapon forges and alchemical laboratories.

They maintain an uneasy but profitable relationship with other Darklands powers, trading their superior craftsmanship and military expertise for resources and territorial concessions. 

Their disciplined armies and advanced siege engines make them formidable opponents that even the dark-elves treat with cautious respect.
