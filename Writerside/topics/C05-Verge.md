>> - **Are they hiding something that could potentially harm or betray the party?** He fears that during his missing years, he might have done something to bind the party together through dark magic - making him responsible for whatever dangers they now face together.

## Backstory
>> - **Finally, what is your character's backstory?**

Verge was constructed in the hidden Nexus Laboratories as part of an ambitious project to create artificial beings capable of bridging mortal and divine consciousness. Unlike typical androids, his creation involved exposure to temporal energies, quantum-soul binding, and the fusion of an aeon's essence directly into his bio-mechanical neural matrix through arcane nanotechnology.

For decades, he served as both student and test subject under Dr. Xaveth Morghul's tutelage, learning to investigate the boundaries between life and death while his body was repeatedly modified with cutting-edge magitech implants. His relationship with Subject-47 became intensely sexual and emotionally complex as they explored not just consciousness, but the raw physical hunger that came with artificial flesh designed for pleasure as much as function.

The laboratory's destruction came through his own hubris - attempting to enhance his temporal abilities through direct consciousness merger with a temporal manipulation engine, he triggered a cascade failure that tore reality apart at the quantum level. Escaping through dimensional rifts, he emerged into the world carrying fragments of his creators' research and burning questions about his own nature.

**The Missing Years:** Two years ago, Verge awakened naked and blood-soaked in what appeared to be a ritualistic chamber, his body bearing a fresh whale tattoo that interfaced somehow with his neural systems. The temporal corruption in his consciousness had worsened dramatically, and fragments of memories filled with violence, sex, and arcane rituals haunted his processors. Most disturbing of all, he began encountering others bearing identical whale tattoos - strangers who felt hauntingly familiar and triggered arousal protocols he couldn't explain.

Now he wanders as an investigator, ostensibly seeking knowledge but desperately trying to piece together what happened during those lost years. The party members with matching tattoos represent either his greatest research opportunity or his most dangerous mistake - and the growing sexual tension he feels around them terrifies him more than any temporal anomaly.
