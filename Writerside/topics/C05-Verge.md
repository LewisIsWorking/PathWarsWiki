>> - A thick leather strap is buckled around his left arm, tight and worn, its purpose unclear—restraint? Reminder? 
>> - Beneath the coat, he is dressed with unsettling precision: a crisp, slate-grey dress shirt, buttoned to the throat; 
>> - black trousers, form-fitting and marked by utilitarian straps at the thigh and waist; and pointed black shoes, polished but scuffed. 
>> - Crimson socks peek subtly above the heel—perhaps a silent nod to blood spilled, or a ritual quirk of habit. His face is sharp and pale, the colour of frostbitten porcelain.
>> - A web of scar tissue runs down the left side of his face and neck, as if clawed or burned in layered stages. 
>> - Beneath the scars, faint neural interface ports gleam like embedded gems, designed for direct consciousness transfer and data download. 
>> - His expression is usually neutral—too neutral—until his crimson cybernetic eye sharpens like a blade, 
>> - its arcane processors analysing threat levels and biological data in real-time. His hair is long and icy blue, 
>> - cascading in wild, tangled strands that partly obscure his face. Nano-filaments woven through each strand allow for electromagnetic manipulation and sensory enhancement. 
>> - From one ear dangles a quantum-crystal earring, its faceted surface containing compressed pocket dimensions for data storage. 
>> - Sometimes, he wears a black blindfold embedded with scrying runes and temporal sensors that pulse with occult significance. 
>> - When worn, it interfaces directly with his optical processors, allowing him to perceive dimensional rifts, magical auras, and the flow of time itself. 
>> - His hands are always gloved in black synthetic skin that conceals retractable surgical implements, drug injection systems, and arcane focusing crystals embedded in his fingertips. 
>> - The gloves also hide the more obvious signs of his artificial nature - joints that separate for maintenance and pleasure enhancement modules he does not discuss.

> Backstory.
>> - Question: Finally, what is your character's backstory?
>> - Answer: Verge was constructed in the hidden Nexus Laboratories as part of an ambitious project to create artificial beings capable of bridging mortal and divine consciousness. 
>> - Unlike typical androids, his creation involved exposure to temporal energies, quantum-soul binding, and the fusion of an aeon's essence directly into his biomechanical neural matrix through arcane nanotechnology. 
>> - For decades, he served as both student and test subject under Dr. Xaveth Morghul's tutelage, learning to investigate the boundaries between life and death while his body was repeatedly modified with cutting-edge magi-tech implants. 
>> - His relationship with Subject-47 became intensely sexual and emotionally complex as they explored not just consciousness, but the raw physical hunger that came with artificial flesh designed for pleasure as much as function. 
>> - The laboratory's destruction came through his own hubris—attempting to enhance his temporal abilities through direct consciousness merger with a temporal manipulation engine, he triggered a cascade failure that tore reality apart at the quantum level. 
>> - Escaping through dimensional rifts, he emerged into the world carrying fragments of his creators' research and burning questions about his own nature. 
>> - **The Missing Years: ** 
>> - Two years ago, Verge awakened naked and blood-soaked in what appeared to be a ritualistic chamber, his body bearing a fresh whale tattoo that interfaced somehow with his neural systems. 
>> - The temporal corruption in his consciousness had worsened dramatically, and fragments of memories filled with violence, sex, and arcane rituals haunted his processors. 
>> - Most disturbing of all, he began encountering others bearing identical whale tattoos—strangers who felt hauntingly familiar and triggered arousal protocols he could not explain. 
>> - Now he wanders as an investigator, ostensibly seeking knowledge but desperately trying to piece together what happened during those lost years. 
>> - The party members with matching tattoos represent either his greatest research opportunity or his most dangerous mistake—and the growing sexual tension he feels around them terrifies him more than any temporal anomaly.
