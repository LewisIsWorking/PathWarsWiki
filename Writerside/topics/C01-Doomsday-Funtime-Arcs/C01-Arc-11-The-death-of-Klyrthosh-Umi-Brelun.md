> PBP
>> - Path Wars: @Nemesiux wants to see the High Mourner. 
>> - Path Wars, [10/01/2026 12:38] Does the party go to the temple of Pharasma? 
>> - Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder], [10/01/2026 23:21] Yee 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 03:17] -= The Church of Pharasma =- 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:23] Magnimar is the City of Monuments, and the Church of Pharasma is partially a monument itself. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:24]
>> - This temple is from the age of legends. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:24]
>> - Since then it has been restored, built around and expanded upon. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:24]
>> - The building's foundation is Sin Empire stonework: massive blocks of rune-carved basalt and other stone. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:25]
>> - The empire of sin built everything to last forever. 
>> - Pharasma and her faith have outlasted the end of that world and endure forever. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:26]
>> - Rising from that foundation, the structure itself is pale blue-grey granite quarried from the Mind-spin Mountains. 
>> - The surface of the building is carved with endless interlocking spirals that catch light differently throughout the day. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:27]
>> - At dawn, they seem to rotate sunwise. 
>> - At dusk, widdershins (counterclockwise). 
>> - The effect is not magical. 
>> - It is merely exceptional craftsmanship requiring a patient understanding of how stone and light converse. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:28]
>> - One object dominates the Magnimarian church of Pharasma. 
>> - It makes travellers stop in the street. 
>> - It makes locals avert their eyes from habit. 
>> - The Monument of Pharasma. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:28]
>> - A thirty-foot statue of the Lady of Graves stands before the entrance. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:29]
>> - The statue is carved from a single block of white marble veined with dark silver. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:30]
>> - The public knows this depiction well: a robed woman of serene authority. 
>> - Pharasma's features are obscured by a deep cowl. 
>> - One of her hands is extended in judgment while her other hand rests upon the pommel of a ceremonial dagger. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:31]
>> - The spiral of fate winds around her feet. 
>> - For she is:
>> - The Judge of Souls. 
>> - The Midwife. 
>> - The Mortician. 
>> - The goddess who ensures all things pass as they should. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:34]
>> - @Nemesiux 
>> - With Selenor's Mastery of Magnimar Lore, you know that this statue is debated; it is odd. 
>> - Details that scholars debate and the clergy decline to explain. 
>> - Her cowl is carved too deeply. 
>> - The shadows within suggest no face at all, just darkness where features should be. 
>> - Her extended hand's fingers are perhaps a touch too long, too thin and strangely the joints have one knuckle more than human anatomy permits. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:35]
>> - Anatomists who've studied the statue note the fingers possess an additional phalange, which means four segments instead of three. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:36]
>> - The ceremonial dagger at her hip is also wrong: too long, the blade too curved, the handle seems to imply the possibility of dual wielding the dagger. 
>> - The dagger: the divine weapon of Pharasma. 
>> - Yet why does it look so wrong? 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:37]
>> - At the feet of the statue is an ancient sin-powered clockwork mechanism that tracks time's passage. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:38]
>> - Gears of brass and silver rotate in precise intervals:
>> - one for heartbeats, 
>> - one for breaths, 
>> - one for days, 
>> - one for years, 
>> - one for ages. 
>> - When a gear completes its cycle, it clicks and begins again. 
>> - The Lady does not move. 
>> - She does not need to. 
>> - Everything comes to her eventually. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:38]
>> - The statue's pedestal bears words carved in Celestial, Common, and Requian (the language of the bone yard):
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:38]
>> - "THE SPIRAL TURNS. 
>> - THE LADY WAITS. 
>> - ALL SOULS COME HOME."
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:39]
>> - Tall windows of frosted glass line the church walls behind her, their panes etched with scenes of life's transitions:
>> - A mother in labour... 
>> - A child taking first steps... 
>> - A warrior falling in battle... 
>> - An elder closing their eyes for the last time... 
>> - Birth and death are given equal weight, equal dignity. 
>> - The spiral connects them all. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:39]
>> - The entrance doors flank the statue's base. 
>> - Silver-chased darkwood, warm to the touch despite the metal. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:40]
>> - The doors to the church (below the statue) are carved with the symbology of the psychopomps: the death angels of Pharasma. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:46]
>> - At the entrance, Selenor, you see a statue. 
>> - It is a plague doctor. 
>> - You look at the statue. 
>> - The statue's masked face is elongated into a ceramic beak. 
>> - Its body is wrapped in layered robes that move independent of wind. 
>> - They carry a staff topped with a soul gem: it is housed in a delicate brass framework that contains pale lights that drift like drowsy fireflies. 
>> - Then the statue moves. 
>> - It moves with a slick movement that is not of this world. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:47]
>> - @Nemesiux 
>> - Selenor. 
>> - Your spirit sense tells you this is not a mortal being of life or unlife. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:49]
>> - The Pharasmin Plague Doctor speaks to you. 
>> - The Plague Doctor's voice resonates from somewhere other than its throat. 
>> - You guess perhaps they speak from the staff... 
>> - Or perhaps nowhere physical at all. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:50]
>> - Plague Doctor:
>> - "Selenor. 
>> - "Your passage here was calculated to finish seventeen minutes ago." 
>> - "You are four minutes early." 
>> - "This creates paperwork."
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:55]
>> - Plague Doctor waits for a moment, not speaking. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:55]
>> - The clockwork dial CLICKS above the Selenor and the rest of the group. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 05:58]
>> - The Plague Doctor:
>> - "The spiral acknowledges your arrival." 
>> - "The Grand Councilwoman Neferpatra Ahnkamen, high priest of Pharasma may have banished you but the lady of the graves has not."
>> - The plague doctor continues:
>> - "You may enter here today but leave your assumptions at the threshold."
>> - "They will not serve you here."
>> - "I will be your guide, do not wander as your title would suggest."
>> - "The High Mourner lays awaiting us in the Garden of Endings."
>> - "Follow swiftly behind me."
>> - "We will arrive there is 3 minutes and 42 seconds."
>> - The plague doctor checks an old brass clockwork time piece, attached on a silver chain that leads somewhere into his cloak. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:00]
The doors swing open as the plague doctor turns. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:00]
>> - -= Inside the Church =- 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:01]
>> - The reception stretches longer than the exterior suggests, a common trick of Pharasmin architecture. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:01]
>> - This space bending trick to remind mortals that destinations are rarely as close as they appear. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:02]
>> - Pews carved from pale ash-wood face an altar dominated by a ten-foot silver spiral. 
>> - The spiral rotates slowly on mechanisms hidden within the floor. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:02]
>> - Each rotation takes exactly one minute. 
>> - The spiral has completed this rotation for hundreds of years. 
>> - It has never stopped. 
>> - It has never needed maintenance. 
>> - Perhaps part of the original building? 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:03]
>> - The walls bear alcoves containing life-masks and death-masks arranged in pairs: plaster impressions taken at birth and at death, displayed together to show the full journey. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:03]
>> - Some pairs span decades. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:03]
>> - Some, tragically, show nearly identical infant faces. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:03]
>> - The church does not discriminate in life & death. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:03]
>> - The church records all passages. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:04]
>> - Clerks in gray vestments move between stations. 
>> - Some attending to ledgers thick as tombstones: (births, deaths, marriages, the last rites requested for many years ahead). 
>> - Other Pharasmians are calibrating brass instruments that measure life force and divine energy. 
>> - A cluster of mourners currently kneel before a side-altar dedicated to stillborn children, their grief held in practiced silence. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:05]
>> - Nearly everyone stops what they are doing and silently stares at the group. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:05]
>> - The previously silent room is still silent, but an awkward, heavy silence. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:06]
>> - Somewhere deeper, an infant cries. 
>> - The church also serves as one of Magnimar's most respected midwiferies. 
>> - Life and death. 
>> - Always both. 
>> - The same priestesses who ease souls into the world ease them out of it. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:07]
>> - A witch of Pharasma gestures toward a door at the reception's far end, marked with a blooming nightshade carved in jet:
>> - "The Garden. She's awaiting you."
>> - Her hushed words carry across the length of the room and to the ears of the group. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:07]
>> - The Plague Doctor strides across the room with impossible grace. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:07]
>> - You go through the door and through a consecrated passage. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:07]
>> - The Plague Doctor:
>> - "Welcome to the Garden of Endings."
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:08]
>> - This garden should not exist. 
>> - Magnimar's Keystone District is dense urban construction. 
>> - There is no room for a garden spanning what appears to be three acres or more. 
>> - Yet here it grows, bounded by walls that are always exactly fifty feet away, no matter how far Selenor and the heroes of Magnimar walk. 
>> - Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:09]
>> - The garden contains plants that flower only in moonlight.

Trees whose leaves fall in perpetual autumn regardless of season, and grave-markers so ancient their names have worn to whispers.

Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:09]
This is no haunted cemetery.

The grounds are immaculately tended, the paths raked clean, the monuments polished.

This is a place of completion, not decay.

Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:10]
Paths of white gravel wind between meditation alcoves where stone benches face open graves.

The graves are not empty, but waiting, reserved for those who have commissioned their resting places in advance.

Some bear names.

Some bear dates that are still in the future.

Pre-planning one's funeral is considered spiritually responsible among Pharasma's faithful.

Anyone with Religion knows this.

Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:11]
At the garden's heart: a fountain.

But instead of water, it pours sand.

The sand is made up of silver and blue grains cascading from a marble spiral into a basin that never fills.

They are constantly draining through hidden channels to begin the cycle again.

Beside it stands a stone table and upon the table: the high mourner.

She lies on the table, in the tea party soul plague coma, the thick black-green infection visible across her face, having spread up from her stomach.

Path Wars, [12/01/2026 06:12]
The Plague Doctor makes his way across the white gravel path to the fountain and stands next to the stone table.

The party follows.

Path Wars, [12/01/2026 08:15]
Plague Doctor:
"Kethran Mournhollow of the Final Ledger."

Path Wars, [12/01/2026 08:17]
Kethran Mournhollow of the Final Ledger:

"The High Mourner's soul is... contested.

Something claims it. Something that should not exist.

The plague is not merely disease.

It is a tether, pulling souls toward a seal or a bond, rather than the Boneyard."

Path Wars, [12/01/2026 08:21]
Kethran Mournhollow of the Final Ledger:

"The Lady showed me a place.
A book.
A prison.

Your friend, a professor, is dead.

You will complete what was left undone.

It will not cure the High Mourner, but it will buy her time.

Time enough for you to find the plague's true source.

Do you understand, Wanderer?

The Lady does not ask.

She informs."

Path Wars, [12/01/2026 08:21]
Kethran Mournhollow of the Final Ledger awaits the party's reply.

Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder], [12/01/2026 21:51]
Selenor kneels before the highmourner and says his piece in a sad tone mixed with rage
“The plague horseman took your daughter’s soul, the death horseman took your husband’s soul and now that stupid rat took yours….

I promise even if they might survive this cycle, it will come at a terrible cost that will scar them forever.
The void shell eye slightly open and it also adds in a quiet whisper in necril “Abbadon shall burn!”

Selenor then turns his gaze towards the plague doctor “Pharasma still has my respect despite the hostility her followers have shown to me. What you told us about the plague we have learned about it at the dawnbringer church. I advice you keep all of the victims alive as much as possible. They are all linked. If one dies, the rest will follow.”

Selenor then stands up and approaches the plague doctor. “The lady guides your souls while I fight those that desire your souls no matter how many times they kill me. Even in death I....have no choice but to fight. I know that Pharasma only informs…. That is what she does. Even when Rovagug was roaming free she only advised the gods how to  fight him. Therefore, please tell me then plague doctor how may I buy the highmourner time?
Inform us about the vision you received.
Do you also know what the highmourner meant by saying she was also studying Pharasma other side as well?
She mentioned this to me when I asked her about the necromatic/undead necklace.
She.... told me she would show it to me later."

Path Wars, [13/01/2026 15:44]
Kethran's ceramic beak tilts. The clockwork timepiece ticks:
"You ask questions that are not mine to answer, Wanderer."

Path Wars, [13/01/2026 16:11]
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger is about to say something...

Path Wars, [13/01/2026 22:45]
Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger tilts his mask away from Selenor, as if not "looking" at him directly then says:

"Of all the servants of all the divines.

The servants of Pharasma are some of the most directly spoken to, directly instructed and directly course-corrected when things drift too far awry.

Still.

Sometimes, some things are left. Strange.

I know of what the High Mourner would divulge to you.

I know not what the Lady of Graves feels of this divulgence in this very moment."

The timepiece clicks 4 times then Kethran Mourn-Hollow of the Final Ledger continues:

"Such a secret would normally be met with attempts at great secrecy.

Yet.

The time approaches when the veil is lifted.

Such attempts at secrecy will matter not.

I think 3 things.

1. The high Mourner will tell you her research. By then you will have earned it.

2. Pharasma thinks if you investigate the death of your professor friend it will save the life of the High Mourner.

3. This is your chance to rejoin the faithful, be welcomed back into these most holy places by your adopted mother D'Bear and take your place among the hierarchy of the faithful.

You will have a choice to make, your soul, your allegiance may yet lie with Pharasma.

Instead of being doomed for eternity...... "

Kyno zyno, [14/01/2026 10:55]
While the party is investigating the Temple of Pharasma, Taru'kara the rogue unbeknownst to the rest of the party would finally arrive in Sandpoint after taking the teleportation circle from Magnimar to Sandpoint. After stepping out of the circle she would take a moment to take in the fresh air, the new seaport smell, the sounds of the city, the people walking by, and so on.

"My oh myyy...so this is Sandpoint huh? Such a lovely city filled with a lively townsfolk and port, reminds me of Otari but a larger one...either way as much as I would love to peruse this place, I've got a party to find."

After taking in the moment, Taru'kara quickly got back to what she was here for, to join the "Heroes of Magnimar" and be a part of their grand journey. She would start by finding the nearest city guard and asking them where the party was last seen.

"Um..hello there, I hate to interrupt but do you know where the Heroes of Magnimar went? I am simply asking cause I would like a...autograph from them, Yes!"

Horia/Mike/Michael/Nem (Selenor) [Pathfinder], [16/01/2026 14:29]
> Selenor raises three fingers:
>> - I also think of 3 things:
>> - "1: I partially earned her trust when I saved the nobles from the daemon corruption and placed a ward on the cemetery."

>> - "2: You still haven't told me anything about this professor or what I need to do to buy the high-mourner time."
>> - "When the plagued doctor mentioned his third point. Selenor visually can be seen emotionally hurt."

>> - "3: I have never worshipped any god. Not even Nethys who I consider an… old friend from a past life."
>> - "I respected your church because D'bear chose to adopt me as her son instead of killing me and for the fact that you have an important divine role."
>> - "I will remind you what you say is empty words."
>> - "Pharasma followers’ actions showed me that she never respected me like I do even tho she could have informed you to at least ignore me."
>> - "I have never caused trouble and I have always protected your church even tho your actions I could consider an act of betrayal."
>> - "Using my mother to trick me into being your divine slave is a low blow even from you."
>> - "I have high expectations of you Pharasma unlike with the other gods such as Sarenrae, Zon-Kuthon, Asmodeus or the Red mantis god who have broken their ancient vow to never touch Golarion."
>> - "I know you know who I am hence why  you gods are so desperate to own my soul, but you are correct about one thing."
>> - "I am doomed for eternity."
>> - "An eternity you have chosen for me, I might add."

> Selenor remains silent for a few seconds and says this in a sad tone mixed with disappointment:
>> - "You fear my grandfather, don’t you?"
>> - "This is why you want my soul."
>> - "You present yourself as a saviour, yet you use the same tactics, like Asmodeus and Zon-Kuthon or even Nethys."
>> - "Manipulation, gaslighting and in your case as well as Zon-Kuthon using my family as a bargaining chip to force me to do your bidding."
>> - "If you really wanted to 'save' me you would have been honest with me from the beginning."
>> - "One good example is that so called 'Dawn-Flower' priest."
>> - "You can’t expect me to trust you if you are going to lie to my face like that."
>> - "You all are the cause of the endtimes..."
>> - "I am not your enemy Pharasma."
>> - "If I was why wouldn’t the horsemen reach out to me to recruit or enslave me to their cause?"
>> - "Just like the other so-called 'heroes' did."

> Selenor eyes then show a look of rage fuelled by sadness as grey fire bursts from his eye sockets.
>> - "My fate was, is, and it will be decided by my family or rather by my grandfather."
>> - "If you really want to help me then tell me how to save the high-mourner, tell me how to save magnimar, tell me how to save Golarion..."
>> - "Inform me how to stop or at least to buy you time. Please..."
>> - "I have given everything hence why my name is Selenor."
>> - "Just like the void I am now nothing."
>> - "A mindless revenant that wanders the world you have damaged in your greed for power and control over it."
