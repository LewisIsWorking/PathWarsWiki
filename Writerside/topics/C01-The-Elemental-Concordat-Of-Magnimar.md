# C01-The-Elemental-Concordat-Of-Magnimar

> Haku's Arrival at the Elemental Concordat.
>> - The cobblestones of Magnimar's Summit district feel alien beneath your talons after a lifetime walking on crystallised air currents. 
>> - The mortal city's stench of sweat, commerce, and magical pollution assaults your keen avian senses. 
>> - A far cry from the pristine storm-winds of your clan's island home. 
>> - Before you raise something that should not exist on this crude material plane:
>> - Five towers of impossible architecture spiralling into the sky like a frozen tornado. 
>> - Your amber eyes immediately recognise the Air Tower. 
>> - Its upper floors hover unsupported, storm-clouds perpetually wreathing its peak. 
>> - The familiar scent of ozone and lightning makes your feathers bristle with homesickness and recognition. 
>> - Crystalline bridges arc between the towers, crackling with elemental energies that make your kineticist blood sing. 
>> - The central Nexus of Balance pulses with a rhythm that matches the planar storms you once danced through.
>> - Its void-glass walls reflect distorted images of all four elements in eternal flux. 
>> - A figure emerges from the main entrance - humanoid but wrong, their flesh bearing the telltale shimmer of elemental exposure. 
>> - Their eyes widen as they take in your silver-winged form, the storm-mark branded into your arm, and the way reality subtly bends around your presence.
>> - "Blessed winds..." they mutter in accented Common, then switch to Auran. 
>> - The language of your birth plane.
>> - "Storm-dancer, you carry the scent of the deep currents. The Concordance has been expecting you."
>> - The elemental energies radiating from the building respond to your presence, air currents swirling around your form unbidden. 
>> - Whatever pulled you through that damned portal to this material hellscape, these people clearly know more about it than you do. 
>> - The question is: do you trust beings who traffic in the same forces that tore you from everything you have ever known? 
>> - What do you do, Haku?
>> - The Concordance clearly has interest in your arrival...and perhaps answers about how to return home. 

> The Nexus of Balance is the central building. 
>> - The fifth structure that the four elemental towers connect to via the crystalline bridges. 
>> - It houses the Seat of Balance operations and serves as the coordination centre for the entire facility.

> The Nexus of Balance is the heart of the Elemental Concordat:
>> - The central spire/tower.
>> - Built from void-glass that reflects all four elements. 
>> - The tallest structure with the Planar Observatory at its apex.
>> - Connected to all four elemental towers via the energy-conducting bridges. 
>> - The hub where all the elemental energies from the other towers converge.
