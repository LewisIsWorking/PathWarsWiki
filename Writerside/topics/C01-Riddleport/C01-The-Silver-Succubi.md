## Overview

> The Silver Succubi is a casino, strip club, and nightclub located in Riddleport. 
>> - It is owned and operated by the crime lord Marlo Kaspar Viktor Cyrus, who runs what is considered a "legitimate" operation by Riddleport standards. 
>> - The dancers are employees (not slaves), the games aren't badly rigged, no one gets roughed up without good reason, and the drinks are actual alcohol. 
>> - The establishment operates on an infernal/succubus theme, with staff dressed as demons, hellish lighting, and a caged imp named Old Scratch who provides entertainment.

---

## Exterior Description

> The Silver Succubi dominates a corner lot in a much-neglected neighbourhood. 
>> - Where other establishments have surrendered to rot and salt-wind decay.
>> - The Silver Succubi is one that gleams with deliberate, vulgar opulence.

### The Dome

> A massive brass half-dome crowns the building.
>> - The dome is tarnished to a greenish-bronze patina that somehow makes the structure look more expensive rather than neglected.
>> - It makes you think of old money that doesn't need to prove itself.

### The Verandas

> Wide verandas wrap the front between two short wings.
>> - They are often occupied by a mix of sailors, merchants and figures whose professions are best left unasked.

### The Statue

> Standing before the main doors is an **eight-foot statue of a succubus**.
>> - It is cast in silver-plated bronze. 
>> - She balances on one cloven hoof atop a pile of coins, her wings spread wide, her expression one of knowing invitation. 
>> - One finger is pressed to her full lips in a gesture of secrecy. 
>> - Her other hand extends palm-up toward the entrance, as if personally welcoming each patron into damnation.

### The Doors

> The doors themselves are dark imported wood, each panel carved with imagery that becomes increasingly explicit the longer you look.
>> - They are covered in symbols of luck and fortune that gradually reveal themselves to be tangled limbs, grasping hands, and suggested acts that would make Calistria herself raise an eyebrow.

## Interior Description

### The Senses

> **Smell:** 
>> - Pipe smoke layered over expensive perfume. 
>> - The sharp bite of quality alcohol. 
>> - The musk of too many bodies pressed together. 
>> - Beneath it all, something faintly sulfurous - brimstone. 
>> - Whether real or an alchemical affectation for the theme, it works.

> **Sound:** 
>> - A wall of noise. 
>> - The grinding rhythm of clockwork instruments. 
>> - The clatter of dice. 
>> - The shuffle of cards. 
>> - Laughter, cursing, the clink of glasses, and somewhere a woman moaning in a way that might be theatrical or might not be.

> **Heat:** 
>> - Braziers burn throughout the room, and with this many bodies packed inside, the air is thick, warm, and dank. 
>> - You're sweating before you've taken three steps.

### The Casino Floor

> The casino floor is a wide room carpeted in rich crimson that's been recently patched in places.
>> - The repairs somehow adding to the lived-in decadence rather than detracting from it. 
>> - The room is massive - easily 100+ metres across and twice as long.

> **Pillars:** 
>> - Dark wood pillars carved with writhing figures support the structure, each one depicting a different scene of temptation and sin:
>> - One shows a man drowning in gold coins
>> - Another shows a woman wrapped in serpents
>> - Others show increasingly explicit scenes

> **Carpet:** 
>> - Soft underfoot, swallowing footsteps. 
>> - Stains that didn't quite come out - wine, blood or something else. 
>> - No one seems to care.

### Gaming Tables

> More than a dozen gaming tables spread throughout the chamber - islands of green felt in the crimson sea.

> **Bounder:** 
>> - A ghoulish severed head mounted on a mechanical arm insults each player in turn, its dead eyes rolling, its grey tongue wagging obscenities. 
>> - Players roar with laughter or curse as coins slide into slots beneath its chin.

> **Ghoulette:** 
>> - A wheel divided into segments painted with leering undead faces. 
>> - A skeletal mechanical hand drops the ball. 
>> - A game that originates in Riddleport, part of the city's cultural history.

> **Skiffs:**
>> - A nine-square grid where sailors argue over the placement of coloured tokens while a bored dealer referees.

> **Golem:**
>> - A card game that looks like poker until you notice the "golem hand".
>> - This is a pile of discarded cards in the centre that can steal victory from the best player at the table.

### The Walls and Ceiling

> **Silken Banners:**
>> - Deep purple and black, over 5 metres tall, embroidered with silver succubus silhouettes. 
>> - The poses start tasteful near the entrance but grow increasingly explicit deeper into the hall. 
>> - By the far wall, the embroidered succubi are engaged in acts that would make a Calistrian priestess take notes.

> **Window Blinds:** 
>> - Wide vertical blinds cover the windows, blocking any hint of the outside world. 
>> - It's always night inside the Silver Succubi, regardless of what the sun thinks.

> **Walls:** 
>> - Painted deep burgundy where visible, mounted with brass sconces shaped like clutching demonic hands, each holding an ever-burning torch that flickers in shades of violet.

> **False Ceiling:** 
>> - Hangs approximately 7 metres up, draped in layers of gauzy fabric in shades of violet and crimson, like frozen smoke. 
>> - The fabric shifts in warm air currents, creating the illusion of breathing. 
>> - Security catwalks exist above the false ceiling for watching cheaters.

> **Clockwork Chandeliers:** 
>> - Massive brass contraptions that rotate slowly on hidden mechanisms. 
>> - Crystal prisms catch the light and scatter it in sweeping beams of crimson and violet across the gaming floor.

> **Copper Braziers:**
>> - The size of bathtubs, filled with live coals that pop and hiss. 
>> - The hellish orange light mingles with the arcane violet. 
>> - Their purpose is atmosphere and warmth rather than illumination.

### The Staff

> **Servers:** 
>> - Wear succubus costumes.
>> - Bat wings of black leather or silk, small devil horns, forked tails. 
>> - Outfits include corsets, stockings, heeled boots, and strategic placement of silver chains and black lace. 
>> - Male and female alike, uniformly attractive (clearly a hiring requirement).

> **Inside Bouncers:** 
>> - Big, scarred, watching. 
>> - Tight black leather suits, expressions of deep boredom. 
>> - Each carries a Gada (1d8 mace) and pistol at minimum, likely more weapons hidden.

> **Outside Bouncers:**
>> - Warriors meant for big trouble. 
>> - Include figures like Davy Crab-Basket (one-eyed orc, mid-tier fighter).

### The Stage

> The main performance stage.
>> - Dominates the eastern wall, raised three feet above the casino floor, framed by heavy black curtains trimmed in silver.

> **Dancers:** 
>> - A trio (two women, one man) work brass poles extending from stage to false ceiling, all in variations of the succubus costume.

> **Clockwork Band:**
>> - Mechanical figures ranging from halfling to elf-sized, sculpted from brass and copper:
>> - A clockwork woman with articulated fingers plays a harpsichord
>> - A clockwork man with a bellows for lungs operates a pipe organ.
>> - A spider-like clockwork creature handles percussion.
>> - The music is surprisingly good - a low, sensual rhythm with an underlying mechanical heartbeat.

### The Silver Chest

> In the centre of the room, on a raised platform of black marble, sits a massive silver (or silver-plated) chest wrapped in decorative chains engraved with Infernal script.

> **Chest Guards:**
>> - Two bare-chested bouncers in exotic foreign garb.
>> - Silk pants, golden sashes, curved scimitars. 
>> - Muscled arms crossed. 
>> - Expressions that invite trouble.

### The Imp.

> High above the chest, suspended in a brass birdcage, crouches an **imp**.
>> - Bat-winged, pointy-tailed, red-skinned, eyes like hot coals. 
>> - Old Scratch owes Marlo a debt and works it off by performing at the establishment. 
>> - He greets newcomers with vulgar Infernal screaming and heavily accented Common:
>> - "WELCOME TO DAMNATION, FRESH MEAT! SPEND FREELY! TIP YOUR SERVERS! AND REMEMBER... THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS!"
