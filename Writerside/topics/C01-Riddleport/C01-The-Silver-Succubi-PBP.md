### Events

**Entering the Silver Succubi**

The party arrived at the Silver Succubi with Beltias Kreun in chains.
- Met door bouncer **Davy Crab-Basket** (one-eyed orc) who recognized Beltias immediately.
- **Old Scratch** (caged imp) greeted them with typical vulgarity.
- A **Shisk server** with vampire-like fangs offered blue bomb shots.

**The Blue Bomb Shots**

Mad Rat explained the "trust shot" tradition - drink it or risk offending the host.

Shot results:
- **Mad Rat** - Took it. "Woooow. Now that. That's good shit."
- **Cardigan** - Took it before Mad Rat finished explaining.
- **Moonshine** - Downed it instantly. "Hm? What?"
- **Rax** - Removed his mask first, revealing clockwork eye and small horns. "Cheers."
- **Necrila** - Reluctantly. "Fine I will drink your poison." (Then ate a severed head and tipped the server a gold coin.)
- **Filliaur** - Took it while smoking flayleaf. Failed addiction save.

The shot effect: A stimulant that sharpens the senses. Alert. Awake. Hyper. Club harder. Dance faster. Gamble with less worry.

**Rax Reveals Himself**

Rax removed his mask and hat, revealing:
- An intricately moving set of gears where an eye should be
- Small black horns poking through his fur
- His true face

Mad Rat noted: "Bold move. Mr Cyrus will appreciate that. The boss of this place doesn't like people who hide."

**Callie Duskbarrel Appears**

A half-elven woman pushed through the crowd: "Oh, for fuck's sake."

**Callie Duskbarrel**, head barmaid, recognized Moonshine immediately:
- "Lenma. Fucking. Moonshine."
- "It's been months. 3 months without you stumbling through MY doors."
- "You look like shit. You smell like shit. Are you eating enough?"

Callie then noticed the bound prisoner and went pale.
- "What have you done."
- Mentioned "Scarlet" under her breath.
- Told the party to stay put: "Don't touch anything. Don't gamble. Don't drink anymore."

She went to alert Marlo.

**The Agents Realize**

The two agents waiting in the main room (Aiden101 and Lokanadya's characters) now understand why they were told to wait tonight.

**Awaiting:** Their response to seeing Beltias Kreun in chains.

**The RuneWheel Spikes**

Cardigan and Necrila felt the RuneWheel's connection spike momentarily.

**Awaiting:** Arcana checks to determine what they sense.
