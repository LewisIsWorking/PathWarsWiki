>> - Rax (at edge of platform).
>> - **32.5 ft up main spiral staircase:**
>> - Professor Filiaur Bluestar.
>> - **25 ft up main spiral staircase:**
>> - Yaseitori.

>> - Professor's Construct Companion.

> Notes for Round 4 (from previous session planning).
>> - Sinhow will be able to reach Beltias Kreun this turn/round.
>> - Sinhow will stride twice and leap out the window taking 10 fall damage and 5 slashing damage from the glass (reflex to halve the glass damage).
>> - Sinhow lands near Beltias Kreun, Beltias is a little bit more North and a little bit more West.
>> - Cardigan will stride, stride, leap, doing the exact same thing as Sinhow.
>> - Window was broken by Sinhow, so subsequent characters take no glass damage.

## ROUND 4: PARTY TURNS

> Sinhow's turn. Round 4.
>> - Starting: 1st floor hallway, 10 ft from window.
>> - Action 1: Stride (Speed 25 ft) — to window.
>> - Action 2: Leap out window — shatters glass, Reflex save vs DC 16: rolled 12 + 10 = 22 (Success, half damage). 2 slashing damage. Falls 20 ft, 10 bludgeoning damage. Lands prone.
>> - Action 3: Stand.
>> - **Total damage: 12 (2 slashing + 10 bludgeoning).**
>> - **End: Ground level outside, standing.**

Sinhow is closest to the window and moves first. He crosses the remaining distance of the hallway in a few quick strides, then without hesitation launches himself at the glass.

The window explodes outward in a shower of glittering shards. Sinhow twists mid-air, shielding his face, and most of the glass skitters harmlessly off his armour. Then the ground rushes up to meet him.

He hits hard, the impact driving through his legs and sending him tumbling across the cobblestones. For a moment he lies there, breath knocked out of him, before forcing himself back to his feet. Blood trickles from a few shallow cuts, but he's up. He's close to Kreun now.

---

> Cardigan's turn. Round 4.
>> - Starting: 1st floor hallway, near bell-tower room (~20 ft from window).
>> - Action 1: Stride (Speed 25 ft) — to window.
>> - Action 2: Leap out window — glass already broken by Sinhow, no slashing damage. Falls 20 ft, 10 bludgeoning damage. Lands prone.
>> - Action 3: Stand.
>> - **Total damage: 10 bludgeoning.**
>> - **End: Ground level outside, standing.**

Cardigan is right behind Sinhow, racing down the hallway as glass rains down ahead of her. She doesn't slow — can't slow — and throws herself through the now-empty window frame.

The fall is brutal. She lands badly, cobblestones biting into her palms and knees, the shock of impact rattling her teeth. But she's a sorcerer, not a soldier, and she's taken worse from failed experiments.

She pushes herself upright, arcane energy already crackling at her fingertips, eyes searching for their quarry.

---

> Lenma Moonshine's turn. Round 4.
>> - Starting: Bottom of spiral staircase.
>> - Action 1: Stride (Speed 30 ft) — 20 ft hallway to window.
>> - Action 2: Leap out window — Cat Fall reduces 20 ft fall to 10 ft effective. 5 bludgeoning damage, halved by Land on Your Feet = 2 bludgeoning. Lands on feet (not prone).
>> - Action 3: Flurry of Blows (Potency Crystal Inner Upheaval, Stunning Blows).
>> - Strike 1: Rolled 20 (miss), Hero Point reroll → 29 (hit). 15 damage (10 bludgeoning + 5 force). Stunning Blows Fort save: Kreun rolled 20 vs DC 18 = Success (not stunned).
>> - Strike 2: Rolled 21 (miss), Hero Point reroll → 19 (still miss).
>> - **Total damage taken: 2 bludgeoning.**
>> - **Damage dealt to Kreun: 15.**
>> - **Hero Points spent: 2.**
>> - **End: Ground level outside, standing, adjacent to Kreun.**

The winter catfolk moves through the hallway with silent precision, her padded feet barely making a sound against the floorboards. She reaches the window just as Cardigan rises from her landing.

Lenma kicks off the sill and drops.

Unlike the others, she lands with preternatural grace — twisting in mid-air, limbs splaying to catch the wind, touching down on all fours like the cat she resembles. The impact barely registers. She rises smoothly, completely unruffled, and in the same fluid motion closes the distance to Kreun.

Her first strike catches him solidly — fist wreathed in crackling force energy that detonates on impact. Kreun staggers, clearly hurt, but shakes off the worst of it. Her follow-up swing whistles past his head as he jerks back at the last second.

---

> Necrila's turn. Round 4.
>> - Starting: 10 ft up main spiral staircase.
>> - Action 1: Stride (Speed 35 ft) — down 10 ft stairs + 20 ft hallway + 5 ft to window.
>> - Action 2: Leap out window — 20 ft fall, 10 bludgeoning damage, lands prone.
>> - Action 3: Stand.
>> - **Total damage: 10 bludgeoning.**
>> - **End: Ground level outside, standing.**

Necrila bursts from the stairwell and charges down the hallway without slowing. The broken window ahead frames the evening sky and a twenty-foot drop to the courtyard. She doesn't hesitate — armour and all, the champion throws herself through the shattered frame.

The fall is short and punishing. She hits the cobblestones hard, the impact ringing through her bones, and crumples into a roll.

But Necrila is made of sterner stuff. She pushes through the pain, forcing herself back to her feet and drawing her weapon in one fluid motion. Her eyes find Kreun immediately.

---

> Yaseitori's turn. Round 4.
>> - Starting: 25 ft up main spiral staircase.
>> - Action 1: Stride (Speed 30 ft) — down 25 ft stairs + 5 ft into hallway.
>> - Action 2: Stride (Speed 30 ft) — 15 ft remaining hallway to window.
>> - Action 3: Leap out window — 20 ft fall, 10 bludgeoning damage, lands prone.
>> - No action remaining to Stand.
>> - **Total damage: 10 bludgeoning.**
>> - **End: Ground level outside, PRONE.**

Yaseitori is further behind, still descending the spiral when the others make their jumps. He pushes himself harder, taking stairs two at a time, then sprints down the hallway toward the broken window.

He leaps without stopping to judge the distance.

The landing goes poorly. Yaseitori hits the ground at an awkward angle, the impact driving the breath from his lungs and sending him sprawling face-first into the dirt. He lies there for a moment, groaning, the world spinning above him.

---

> Rax's turn. Round 4.
>> - Starting: 100 ft (top of bell tower).
>> - 3 × Stride (Speed 35 ft = 105 ft total).
>> - Path: 35 ft down final stairs + 15 ft across Kreun's room + 55 ft down main spiral = 105 ft.
>> - **End: 10 ft up main spiral staircase.**

From the top of the bell tower, Rax can see the situation unfolding below — Kreun back on his feet, the construct looming beside him, and his allies pouring out of the temple. The ratfolk abandons his position on the platform and bolts for the stairs.

He descends as fast as his legs will carry him, tearing through Kreun's abandoned room and into the main spiral staircase. His alchemical bandolier rattles against his chest with every step, vials clinking together. The tower seems endless.

By the time he stops to catch his breath, he's barely a quarter of the way down.

> Professor Filiaur Bluestar's turn. Round 4.
>> - Starting: 32.5 ft up main spiral staircase.
>> - Action 1: Stride (Speed 30 ft) — down stairs to 1st floor.
>> - Action 2: Stride (Speed 30 ft) — through hallway to window edge.
>> - Action 3: Command construct — Grapple (rolled 18, fail), Reposition (fail).
>> - **End: At window edge, 1st floor.**

Professor Filiaur Bluestar descends the remaining stairs and rushes through the hallway, skidding to a halt at the shattered window. Below, she can see the chaos unfolding — her construct grappling at Kreun, her allies surrounding him.

She barks a command to her construct, but Kreun twists away from both the grapple attempt and the follow-up repositioning. The construct's brass fingers close on empty air.

> Rax's turn. Round 4.
>> - Starting: 100 ft (top of bell tower).
>> - 3 × Stride (Speed 35 ft = 105 ft total).
>> - Path: 35 ft down final stairs + 15 ft across Kreun's room + 55 ft down main spiral = 105 ft.
>> - **End: 10 ft up main spiral staircase.**

From the top of the bell tower, Rax can see the situation unfolding below — Kreun back on his feet, the construct looming beside him, and his allies pouring out of the temple. The ratfolk abandons his position on the platform and bolts for the stairs.

He descends as fast as his legs will carry him, tearing through Kreun's abandoned room and into the main spiral staircase. His alchemical bandolier rattles against his chest with every step, vials clinking together. The tower seems endless.

By the time he stops to catch his breath, he's barely a quarter of the way down.

> Mad Rat's turn. Round 4.
>> - Action 1: Strike (crossbow) — miss.
>> - Action 2: Reload.
>> - Action 3: Strike (crossbow) — miss.
>> - **End: Top of bell tower (100 ft).**

Mad Rat steadies his crossbow against the platform railing, sighting down at Kreun far below. The bolt flies wide, clattering off cobblestones. He curses, reloads with practised speed, and fires again. Another miss — the range and the chaos of melee making precision impossible.
