# Beltias-Kreun-fight

> Campaign: Riddleport. 

> 2025-09-12th.
>> - Claude:
>> - Based on the context, I would recommend 60-70 feet vertically from the base of the spiral stairs to Beltias Kreun's room.
>> - Here is the reasoning:
>> - Total bell tower height: 100 feet.
>> - Beltias Kreun's room is "below the top of the bell tower".
>> - The hallway (starting point) is on the 2nd floor, so roughly 10-15 feet above ground.
>> - This leaves about 25-30 feet from Beltias' room to the top of the tower.
>> - Therefore, 60-70 feet from the base of the spiral stairs to his room provide good tactical positioning while keeping him close enough to the bell platform for story purposes.
>> - Stair rules:
>> - Stairs are difficult terrain for characters moving up them, and shoddy stairs might also be uneven ground.
>> - Some temples and giant-built structures have enormous stairs that are greater difficult terrain both up and down, or might require Climbing every step.
>> - Difficult terrain:
>> - Difficult terrain is any terrain that impedes your movement, ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to thick ground cover and countless other impediments.
>> - Moving into a square of difficult terrain (or moving 5 feet into or within an area of difficult terrain if you are not using a grid) costs an extra 5 feet of movement.
>> - Moving into a square of greater difficult terrain instead costs 10 additional feet of movement.
>> - This additional cost is not increased further when moving diagonally.
>> - You cannot Step into difficult terrain.
>> - Movement you make while jumping ignores the terrain you are jumping over.
>> - Some abilities (such as flight or being incorporeal) allow you to avoid the movement reduction from some types of difficult terrain.
>> - My notes:
>> - We are using a grid.
>> - Claude calculating how many actions to get to Beltias Kreun's room:
>> - Based on the given information, I will calculate the movement needed:
>> - Distance calculation:
>> - From the base of spiral stairs to Beltias Kreun's room: 60-70 feet (using 65 feet as the middle estimate).
>> - Movement with difficult terrain:
>> - Normal movement: 25 feet per move action.
>> - Difficult terrain (stairs going up): costs an extra 5 feet per square moved.
>> - On a grid, each square is 5 feet.
>> - Moving upstairs: each 5-foot square costs 10 feet of movement (5 base + 5 extra).
>> - Actions required:
>> - Total movement needed: 65 feet = 13 squares.
>> - Movement cost per square: 10 feet.
>> - Total movement cost: 13 × 10 = 130 feet.
>> - Movement per action: 25 feet.
>> - Actions needed: 130 ÷ 25 = 5.2 actions.
>> - Therefore, it will take 6 actions (rounding up) to reach Beltias Kreun's room from the base of the spiral stairs.
>> - Assuming you use your move action each turn to climb the stairs.
>> - My notes:
>> - The party needs to open the door to the spiral stairs room first.
>> - The party are right outside the door to the spiral stairs room.
>> - So Cardigan will step (1-A) to the door, open the door (1-A) and then stride across the room and start climbing the stairs (1-A).
>> - Claude: How far can Cardigan get?
>> - Based on Cardigan's planned actions and movement:
>> - Cardigan's turn breakdown:
>> - Action 1: Step to the door (5 feet)
>> - Action 2: Open door (Interact action)
>> - Action 3: Stride across the room and start climbing stairs (25 feet)
>> - Movement calculation:
>> - Step to the door: 5 feet on flat ground
>> - Stride across the spiral stairs room:
>> - Let us assume 10 feet to reach the base of stairs.
>> - Remaining movement for stairs: 25 - 10 = 15 feet of movement
>> - On difficult terrain stairs: 15 feet of movement = 1.5 squares up the stairs.
>> - Rounding down: 1 square up the spiral stairs
>> - Result: Cardigan can get 1 square (5 feet vertically) up the spiral stairs on her first turn.
>> - She will be at the very beginning of her climb, having used her full movement to get into position and start ascending.
>> - She will need 5 more full move actions (6 total turns) to reach Beltias Kreun's room, assuming she uses her Stride action each subsequent turn.
>> - My notes:
>> - Cardigan does this, the door to the spiral stairs room is now open, and she is 5 feet up the spiral stairs.
>> - Rax asks:
>> - "So, with my current movement speed, how far can I get up the stairs? I have 35 feet between my hooves and fleet."
>> - Claude: How far can Rax get?
>> - Based on Rax's movement capabilities with the door already open:
>> - Rax's turn with the door already open:
>> - Action 1: Stride to stairs and climb (35 feet total).
>> - Action 2: Stride further upstairs (35 feet).
>> - Action 3: Stride further upstairs (35 feet).
>> - Movement calculation:
>> - First Stride: 10 feet across room + 25 feet climbing = 2.5 squares upstairs.
>> - Second Stride: 35 feet climbing = 3.5 squares upstairs.
>> - Third Stride: 35 feet climbing = 3.5 squares upstairs.
>> - Total progress:
>> - 2.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 = 9.5 squares (47.5 feet vertically) up the spiral stairs.
>> - Since you need 13 squares total to reach Beltias Kreun's room, you would be about 73% of the way there in one turn, needing only 3.5 more squares (1 more action) to reach the top.

> 2025-09-23rd September, Tuesday.
>> - Remainder of Round 1.
>> - Everyone is going to move up the stairs at max speed.
>> - Except Yaseitori (Flurry Ranger and Monk, @Askarans) who is already at the top of the bell tower.

> Based on the session notes for the Riddleport campaign, here is how far everyone is up the bell tower stairs at the end of their turns.
>> - In the first round of combat:
>> - Yaseitori: Is already at the top of the bell tower.
>> - Rax & Necrila: 47.5 feet up the stairs.
>> - Professor Filiaur Bluestar & Lenma Moonshine: 40 feet up the stairs.
>> - Sinhow: 32.5 feet up the stairs.
>> - Cardigan: 5 feet up the stairs.

> Round 1.
>> - Enemy turn.
>> - Beltias Kreun's turn.
>> - Beltias Kreun: Speed = 35 feet.
>> - With a speed of 35 feet, Beltias Kreun can open his door and reach the bell at the top of the tower in a single turn.
>> - Here is the breakdown:
>> - • Action 1: Open the door to the stairs.
>> - • Actions 2 & 3: Use two Stride actions for a total of 70 feet of movement.
>> - The distance from his room to the bell is about 25-30 feet up the stairs.
>> - Since stairs are difficult terrain when moving up, this would cost 50-60 feet of movement.
>> - As he has 70 feet of movement available, he can comfortably reach the bell.

> Telling Yaseitori.
>> - This man appears, running up the stairs, he is now next to the bell of the bell tower.
>> - He sees you, he is surprised.
>> - It is Beltias Kreun

> Round 2.

> Round 2: Cardigan.
>> - After using three Stride actions, Cardigan would be 42.5 feet up the stairs.
>> - Here is the breakdown:
>> - Total Movement: 3 Stride actions at 25 feet each = 75 feet of movement.
>> - Movement on Stairs: Since stairs are difficult terrain when moving up, the movement cost is doubled.
>> - So, her 75 feet of movement allow her to ascend 37.5 feet.
>> - New Position: Starting from 5 feet up, she moves another 37.5 feet, placing her at 42.5 feet up the stairs.

> Round 2 Movement Summary
>> - Assuming everyone uses their three actions to Stride up the stairs, accounting for the difficult terrain of the stairs and the flat ground of Kreun's room (assumed to be 15 feet to cross).
>> - Rax & Necrila (Speed 35 ft):
>> - They have enough movement (105 ft) to climb the remaining 17.5 ft of the first stairs (costing 35 ft), cross Kreun's 15 ft room (costing 15 ft), and climb the final 25 ft of stairs to the top (costing 50 ft).
>> - End of Round 2: They reach the top of the bell tower, joining Yaseitori and Beltias Kreun.
>> - Professor Filiaur Bluestar & Lenma Moonshine (Speed 30 ft):
>> - They have 90 ft of movement. They climb the remaining 25 ft of the first stairs (costing 50 ft) and cross Kreun's room (costing 15 ft).
