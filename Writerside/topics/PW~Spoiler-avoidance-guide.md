# Spoiler-avoidance-guide

- I may be insane.
- This is just my personal thoughts.

Actions prone to running into spoilers:

1. Googling Pathfinder.
2. Reading Pathfinder books.
3. Searching for Pathfinder material.

I would ask you, pretty pretty please don't do these things.

Why?

Spoilers.

Spoilers are everywhere.

Spoilers for the campaign are **very** easy to stumble upon!

Please do not go on these websites:

1. Pathfinder Wiki.
2. Pathfinder Fandom Wiki.
3. D20 PF SRD.

What about the Archives of Nethys?

Archives of Nethys can be the best resource to access Pathfinder 2e content.

It does have uncommon, rare and other potentially spoiler-y content all plopped in together.

If you do use Archives of Nethys just please be very careful or consider using PF2e Easy Tools.

üíõ

Please do not mention Paizo modules by name or discuss their content on the discord server, telegram, with other players AND especially not during a session.

Where do you read the rules then?

Easy tools.

Easy tools have a ‚ÄúPlayer Mode‚Äù you can enable to hide spoilers from yourself.

### What if I already know lore?

Please don‚Äôt mention it to other players <3
