## Rune wheel.

> By Ross.

So they ended the seagull island arc, and as a result found this weird thing.

After Tammerhawk and a few other great arcane minds spent time researching it,
they found out they can use the rune wheel as a sort of window into the past. 

We would be experiencing it sort of like actors without a script,
being where we are supposed to be without knowing exactly what our role is.

Tammerhawk ended up spending an entire fortune and like,
every even mildly magical man (I mean seriously, she included carnon in the ritual) to activate it.
Then asked us to view the past and help her sort out her memories.

The Beetle was slain by many mages. 

The shell of this beetle has a city around it.

Feathered Turban.

We are searching for the Scarab jewels? Each is priceless and a powerful magical artifact with the ability to unlock the ancient knowledge and magic of Ancient Osiria. Amemphious believes that the lack of these jewels him impotent. The diamond sage has these jewels? In the something desert. The diamond sage is necessary to conduct the Ritual of the Jewels. Amephious has other leads. This city is strange, and has magical protections that will raise alarms should we teleport into this city. Ancient stone walls surround Etho, they are magically warded, hundreds of metres tall and are impossible to climb. Go into the city, meet with the information broker. Find the Diamond Sage. House of the White Urius. Not near the slums. Rich part of the city.

Carnon gets the contact information of a City Guide. 
There is a pregnant griffin around? 
"Mahoo" is the gatekeeper Customs Agent is a challenging boss,
but through MANY meandering checks we eventually ended up crafting a fake geode, and gave it to them to hold it.

Etho Bazaar is where merchants would not try to scam non-locals.
He goes through us one by one.
Selenor is undead and necromancer scum, but necromancer scum is allowed!
The ultimate authority on Pharasma is in the capital city of Osiria.
Inebni Andabar.

Necromancer scum might be interested in The Grand Library ran by Khamos Al-Awlaq.

The most powerful follower of Lemashtu lives in the hills. 
8th rank spell-caster.

MAHOO TAKES CARNONS HERBS AND SPICES.
Mahoo gives the party a Merchants Docket.

House of the White Cobra.
Viole harasses a pompous local who is able to point us in the right direction.
Carnon is sent to the Osirian Black site because they would not remove their skin.
Liar joins them.
The main group is given alcohol,
Selenor gives Cardigan alcohol then remembers
that Cardigan goes into a murderous and lustful rage if she drinks alcohol.
Allisee gives Cardigan hot tub water instead of Alcohol, it tastes like toe cheese.

Torch of the Shadow Government gives us tasks. When completed, we will learn about the Diamond Sage.
- Slip a book into Professor Lozar's Belongings. School of Sciences.
- Get artefacts from the wall? Find stash within the wall. Deliver to Torch.
- Madam Zelekhati. Seduce her secrets out of her?
- Secret from the hundred-finger Gang. Viole has passcode/passphrase?

Viole just murdered a man, just for fun?? 
They can resurrect him to find the criminal. 
We go investigate the wall that The Shadow government told us about. 
Find a bunch of wells. 
There are snakes in the well. 
Main big well has black rancid water.
 Water reacts strange to Allisee, clumps up? heats up and evaporates when Lire and Viole touches it. Divine magic, as old as lissala. 
Allisee descends into the water, very slowly swimming down until she reaches a room.
 There is a diamond shaped hot tub. Some checks reveal a lever, and a man who is definitely not Nethys. 
Allisee gets into combat with two massive snakes. After 1 minute, Viole jumps in after Allisee, quite heroically. Carnon follows, and falls on a snake killing it. 

Vision with Sarenrae?

Session 231 Summary
Setting:
Time: 2025 January 5th IRL / 4710 AR, 29th Arodus (Golarion date).
Context: Third part of the Osiria Ritual arc.
Key Developments and Events:
Preparation for Madamne Zelekhati Encounter:
Cardigan acquires a map of Osiria.
Selenor struggles with using maps effectively.
Viole's Directive: The group is advised not to escalate or draw blood during the encounter with Madamne Zelekhati, who is revealed to be an elven supremacist.
The Bazaar and its Mysteries:
The group explores the Eto Bazaar, a chaotic market known for its rejection of Absalom Trade Standards and its mix of financial statuses.
Haggling dominates the bazaar as the group seeks a gift for Madamne Zelekhati.
Obo the Candle Merchant:
The group meets Obo, a goblin merchant selling magical, colorful candles and rare magical dust.
Obo's Backstory:
His family’s lineage is tied to the Living Prismatic Spear, an ancient entity described as an eternal guardian of light and flame, born from chaos in the deep ground.
His mother, Mobo, was known as the "Twilight Wanderer" and a devout worshiper of Sarenrae. She was killed by the Living Prismatic Spear, leaving Obo with a legacy of grief and vengeance.
Magical Offerings:
Obo offers Envy Dust, a rare substance found in ruins of the Ancient Osirian and Sin Empire, for 9 gold pieces.
The dust is said to enhance or dispel abjuration magic.
Condition: The party must swear to confront the Living Prismatic Spear to gain Obo's full support.
Archon Star Mace:
A family heirloom obtained generations ago from the vault of the Living Prismatic Spear.
Obo offers the mace to the party, describing it as linked to a “tear in the veil” between worlds.
Carnon’s Experience: While holding the mace, Carnon has a vivid vision of being crushed by a golem in a starry expanse.
Gold Rush and Hidden Riches:
The discussion reveals that much of Osiria lies buried beneath hundreds of feet of sand, hiding untold artifacts and treasures.
If fully unearthed, Osiria could become a world superpower.
Lire’s Contribution:
Lire records Obo's tale in a written work titled "The Candle Soul Legacy" and gifts it to Obo.

The Candle Soul Legacy
Written by Lire, this tale captures Obo’s history and motivations:
Mobo, the Twilight Wanderer: Obo’s mother, a devout follower of Sarenrae, wove divine tales into her trade.
The Living Prismatic Spear: A demigod born of chaos and ancient magics, responsible for Mobo's death.
Obo's Resolve: Driven by vengeance, Obo seeks heroes to challenge the entity that claimed his mother and threatens the divine order.


> Lire's message to Obo.

>> - Yet it was not the desert sun that claimed her life, but an entity of unfathomable power—the Living Prismatic Sphere, 
a living demigod born of ancient magics and unbridled wrath.

>> - His family’s connection to Sarenrae was deeper than most understood. 
>> - They bore a spiritual truth known as the Candle Soul—a fragment of divine light that had illuminated their lineage for centuries.

## Session 232 22 3 2025 

The party discusses our options in regards to the other two tasks, but torch needs to speak with Viole. Viole gets put into the Orisian Blacksite and has a car battery strapped to their balls. The party goes to the Academy to attempt to scout it out. The Academy is surrounded by walls, just like Eto itself is. Not as old, but they rhyme. A more modern Orsirian design. There has been some recent renovations in places. The outside of the walls are very tall. 10+ metres tall. The Academy is round and has spires that rise up. Each one with a Golem and Guard. 

Steady stream in and out, even at this late hour. They flash a badge or ring to gain access. Very brief interaction. The guard seem relaxed, chatting to students. We enter a bar called '[[The Sandy Pot]]' An elven man looks at us with a squint in their eyes. Bouncer. They ask us if we are students, and looking at Carnon he decides we are not. We are not allowed into the bar with our weapons AND extradimensional spaces. Student discounts? hell yeah. Viole veils us to look like your average student. And an ogre... 

The party returns to the Bathhouses, and sleep for the night. We are given breakfast. Dried meats and cactus berries. Viole and Allisee learn a spell. We attempt to enter the Academy, but we are stopped and told to check in our gear at the entrance. We do so, and Carnon is stopped because of his MASSIVE CHAD NATURE. Carnon attempts to lie, but fails miserably. He manages to save the conversation by saying he is a bodyguard. With some attention to Allisee ring, we enter the Academy. 

This academy has a lot of weird things. Carnon feels a wave of motion sickness from their Numerian enhanced armour. Some vibration that comes from both the ground and the Academy, feels like a pull from within a building. Large domed building with cylindrical walls built into it. Sandstone that a tinging beige colour. Etched into it is a combination of Magical Runes or celestial starsigns / constellations. Magical signature that Allisee does not like? We try to find the people preparing for the expedition. Anthony requires 20ccs of Goon dust 2 or else he dies. Allisee thinks every school is different. We need to find some security guys to disguise into. Allisee finds a 123 year old Elven girl. She doesn't but a half elf might know. There is a class on the 'Osirian Patheon and what happened to them' ran by Prof. Lozar. Lozar will be in class until 12, then he will prepare to leave for the expedition. The pillars of the sun. A large operation, mostly packed already. "lots of moving parts" Prof. Lozar is racist? 'He doesn't understand our culture' His classes are up one of the platform that go to the floating buildings. Room 141. Apparently they are smashing.

Allisee freaks out because she only went to one school, and not all of them. Prof. Lozar has an airballoon? We go to the male bathroom to disguise ourselves. Allisee looks like a girl you dick down after an exam and then don't make eye contact afterwards. There's a Dues Ex Stoner in the bathrooms, who Viole a spliff. We leave the bathroom, and go downstairs to the administration building. An old decrepit human with eyes that are devoid of humanity approaches us. This man speaks with sand in his throat. Lozar will be meeting with the expedition crew in THE hall of eternal learning, the time is nigh you will soon be departing. Make your way there, or you WILL HAVE TO FILE A LATE FORM. Allisee is given a rock to lead the way. Carnon goes to the Magical Academy black site with Cardigan. We enter the office with loads of people that have black hoods going around doing administrative tasks. We go up to the platform and engravings of Topp, and all kinds of Osirian figures on a boat. We see these merge into newer paintings of Scholarly engravings as we reach to the top. The sand throat man touches the wall and Carnon gets a bit of sea sickness. The sand throat man enters his office and clicks his fingers, lighting up the many book stacks and a desk that is clearly imported.
He pulls out chairs from a spacious pouch. [[Khamos al-alwaq]], the dean of the Library has us in his office, and requests proof that "we have glimpsed Divinity" Carnon asks for more information, gets shut down, and lays his ignorance bare. He worships Nimbaloth. He tells carnon "What has weaved you together to make you turn away from stars" He has known about the end of days for 108 years, and chosen his side long before. There are pieces and chunks and parts of the Goddess in Carnon, yet whoever has made Carnon has denied him the pleasures of he whispers and feelings in his flesh. He pulls out a white vial that seems to twist and turn and turn more and more opague. On the top of the hourglass has a moonstopper, with an intentionally etched vial on the top. She has been awoken. Let yourself be free to make your own choice.

Carnon drinks this vial and begins to convulse. Carnon feels like they have decsended into a swamp of deep tendrils and nauseas vines. A hand pulls his ankle, and the transition POPS as Carnon stands in front of an obelix that is clearly alien and scifi themed, with a slight hum. Carnon sense that the device reaches into their own mind. It feels like touching a cool, yet burning mind. Thick gooey sap stops massive amounts of mathematical formula and signs. Reality starts to fall apart as Carnon feels like they are melding into the black floor like wet tissue paper. Carnon starts to feel like they are bursting into this realm that is folding into itself like origami. Carnon has been dissolved into particles of awareness and unawareness. Carnon's life flashes before his eyes, as long with every possibility their life could have taken. A dodecahedron unfurled upon a crystal cosmic lotus blooms around Carnon. They are dead, stabbed to death. Sad about the stabbing, like a betrayal by a friend, perhaps a lover. The colours are beyond imagination, beautiful beyond belief. Deeper and deeper into this labyrinth of complexity. Thousands of species watching Carnon from above, not unlike a death star. Carnon is slowly loosing their fitting. Old things dwell here. Old things that have been killed and crystalized. Slowly drained of their power to power something new - endless planet of planetoids that stretch into the infinite. This is too much for Carnon, Carnon cannot take the infinite. A dying woman brought all this into existence. A beautiful woman with long mossy hair through the swamps, bring Carnon with her. Carnon sits within her womb, as she knits them anew. Standing upon a monolithic star ship above Gollorion. She is ready to remove Carnon from the guardianship of an abusive father who has denied Carnon of knowing the existence of their mother. Carnon becomes something new, something destructive. Without the capacity to stop themselves from what needs to be done. Carnon will save the world. Take on a small boon, or separate yourself and you may be unable to return, and reconnect. Plant Daddy, or Space Mommy. Carnon accepts the boon. Carnon's wooden arm becomes metallic. Carnon accepts the side of the metallic, of the machine, of the industry, of the civilized. From tufts of moss grow from the metallic flesh. The bottom of their feet become a jaw. 

Carnon awakes, Cardigan above them, sweating and exhausting. She says "It has been a struggle to keep you alive" Khamos asks "How do you feel" And Carnon feels odd about that, he meditates a bit and casts Augury. "Was this a good choice?" the augury answers no.
