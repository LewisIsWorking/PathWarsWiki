# DF-Book of the Sunken-tower-library

## Table of Contents.

## What is this?

These are books taken from an ancient Thassilonian library from a plane that shouldn't exist from outside reality.

The books below are primarily spell books, but they do hold some secrets.

## 1. Joys of Deceit.

The lunatic ravings of an insane Thassilonian Specialist Wizard, a practitioner of Sin Magic.

It seems they attempted to summon a Quippoth, succeeded and lost their mind for their trouble.

Most of the arcane notions are useless, but a couple of spells look like they could be studied and learnt.

The book contains the spells: invisibility and phantasmal force.

## 2. The Whispering Skull.

This book contains an extra dimension space.

Inside the book’s space is a skull that is chained to the book’s extra-dimensional space.

The skull of a mage whose identity has been lost to time.

The skull whispers the contents of the book to you, the reader.

The skull can teach you: animate dead, darkness, fear, and vampiric touch.

And perhaps more…

## 3. An Abjurer’s Guide To Envy.

A spell book aimed at Thassilonian Wizards specialising in the Sin Magic of Envy studying in Edasseril.

Before learning to wield sin, they must learn the essentials of abjuration.

> "Abjuration is a school of magic. 
> - It deals with protective spells and the suppression of others' magic. 
> - Magic of this school creates physical or magical barriers, negates magical or physical abilities, harms trespassers, 
> - Or even banish the target of the spell to another plane of existence!
> - Wizards who specialise in this type of magic are known as abjurers or abjurists."

Contains the spells:

1. Arcane lock.
2. Counter spell.
3. Dispel magic.
4. Glyph of warding.
5. Protection from energy.
6. Remove curse.

## 4. The Works of **Xirie, the first Runelord of Sloth**.

A semi-fictional account of the life and works of the grand conjurer Xirie.

Xirie was killed by Angothane, the second Runelord of Wrath.

The spells contained in the book are related to the crazy stories in the book rather than conjuration.

5. Circle of Protection (UNCOMMON!).
6. Phantom Steed.

## 5. Unattributed blueprints detailing the construction of a secret chest.

Someone called Azaven wrote these blueprints and the instruction manual.

Azaven refers to himself as the lead Gluttony wizard (necromancer) of the Ravenous Crypts of Gluttony.

Azaven makes reference to the fact that he has existed since the founding of the Thassilonian Empire.

At the time of the book's setting, the most freedom to conduct his research ever, referring to the time after the 
death of Xin.

This book describes the construction of a secret chest.

It also describes a very minor artefact called The Book of Secrets.

The Book of Secrets seems to be a somewhat intelligent magical artefact.

You may ask for more information.

The Secret Chest.

This construction lets you gain a permanent secret chest.

(See secret chest spell).

Cost: 300 GPs.

This secret chest can support life if provided with air, food and water.

Time passes normally within the chest.

The secret chest is permanent.

You can summon and dismiss the chest with 1 action.

It will appear anywhere within 5 feet (1.52 m) of you, it is your choice where exactly.

You can set whether or not the chest will appear next to you upon your death.

Changing the on-death behaviour is a free action.

If you choose it not to appear next to you then it will be placed randomly on the Ethereal Plane.

## 6. Librams of the Shadow Council.

A compilation of spell-books extracted from the ruins of previous Runelord Aethusa arch-necromancer’s stronghold.

> "I sense death.

I shall embrace this death to return to life. 
When the end is over, I shall have my new beginning.

## 10. Book of the Spellguard.

Due to transcription errors, many of the spells contained the spells in this tome are worthless.

The errors seem to stem from strange random acts of censorship.

Random pages and paragraphs completely marked through in ink.

It seems the spell guard was some sort of mage slayer guild.

They bare a striking resemblance to the modern-day Midnight Legates.

The salvageable spells are:

1. Invisibility.
2. Resilient sphere.

In addition to its spells, this tome contains a detailed account of the wizard Amadan’s quest to create a simulacrum of the perfect human woman.

An anonymous study of the nature of infernal realms.

The word machines in the title refers to the inner works of Hell as opposed to an actual physical machine.

On the other hand, with the tight-knit, ruthlessly efficient, tightly controlled way that Hell is ran, it could be 
argued that Hell is the machine. 

Devil-kind being the cogs of the machine.

Hell is ruled by the arch devils.

Contains the spells:

1. Cloud Kill.
2. Cone of cold.
3. Wall of fire.
