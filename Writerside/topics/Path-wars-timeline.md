# PathWars-timeline

Anything that happens across any campaign run by the Path Wars collective is canon across all the campaigns.

This means in practise that an event that happens in Crimson Throne (4708 AR) has canonically happened in the past of campaigns set in the future such as Doomsday Funtime (4709 AR → 4710 AR onwards).
