## Zutlieg’s Session 177 = Saturday 3rd June 2023 +  **Wealday
** 20th Erastus, 4710 AR + Harrow Part 20 + Rabbit Prince 4..

A dying clearing in the forest with brain-tasting soil.
There seem to be brains infused in the dirt of the area.
Strange illusion-type stones.
the ground has been sanctified in some dark way. took a little bit of the dirt to have analyzed later by an expert. Trying to figure out what is going on. Detecting illusion magic. This is the heart of this magical emanation, which is emanating for miles around. Allissee solves spiral stone puzzel.

we entered and went down the spiral staircase to a black door with black crystal.
Amar touches the crystal and it hurts her mind, but the door opens to a small circular chamber with several animal corpses around and several tentacles have glass screens with images of circular crystal-looking objects of a blue hue. the creature has a biological "eye" in the mid of its floating being. Lots of tentacles. it attacks. Zutlieg epically casts inspire courage and heroics for a +3 Selenor hits the monster hard Amar crits the creature for massive damage with her rapier creature dies, and screen monitors flicker out Get to the large river with large silver fish jumping all about. An old-looking bridge made of a tree woven with nature's magic to cross the river forming branch-like planks across leaves weaving cabling, ancient magic An ancient Erastil lands. the hunting grounds of Erastil crossing the bridge Laucian gets a bunch of information about being a druid. We take ten for Laucian to pray and commune with the spirits of the land. he connects deeply to the land and sees a vision of an elk the size of a mountain gazing down at us and the forest. the elk seems to send out a wave of energy. we see a whirlpool form around Laucian and a fire-coloured fish comes out nibbling on Planckton and he hears "That is strange, the prayer was super successful... they hunt the fish" Laucian took Alissee's fishing rod to catch the fish "The god of the harvest has brought you a fish prepare it in a good way. Use it and the land but do not abuse" He cleans the fish and eats it raw He feels good and sees mossy skulls of elk looking down on him. feels a stone in my stomach. water from the river starts flowing out of his mouth, a flower grows out of his cheeks, gags and spits up a preserved silver symbol of art preserved in amber. ancient. Zutlieg transforms a stone to look like the Erastil crystal and takes it in his sleeve. makes some notes on its holy symbol skull of elk, predates modern form of Erastil worship, it worships an elk hunter, not a man hunter, pre Erastil / true Erastil? the most traditional form of Erastil, living in a forest, a real part of nature, a hunting/foraging god living in harmony with nature. a holy symbol. seems strongly connected with a long history. Selenor communicates with Laucian, who translates to his familiar. dodged a trap on the bridge and now fighting 2 sharks and dwarf assassins. 3 party members fell into the water with the sharks. Zutlieg shields himself and takes cover Laucian blasts the sharks with electric energy. One eats shit, the other shrugs it off. not so injured shark gets a second attack and takes a bunch of damage. Laucian struggles to stay afloat.

Isilynorsprouts wings and flys out to hover just above the water cardigan stays above water and buffs up to strike a shark selenor shifts over to the shark and hits him hard, exploding the shark's head with his mace Amar steps up to the shark and slices it up like a champ. the shark is easily killed everyone jumps in the water to get away from the dwarves, floating along with the current and we cross the river. an illusion of the dwarves turns to bugbears assassins and they swing away in the trees.
carry on along the valley into more of a corridor in a mountainous region cold snowy, a lost Erastil grove. destroyed ancient. Zutlieg notices some spike traps. they were pretty obvious. and he sees another one to go around. he finally finds all the traps and leads the party safely through the rocky Erastil ritual grounds. lots of ancient inscriptions around go to move past grove and from all directions 4 archers dwarven assassins and in the middle a dark elf-looking guy steps out Kale the Calistrian he's been paid a lot to deal with anyone who might get in the way... he swishes his blade and it turns to fire and wants to fight
zutlieg hastes everyone and inspires courage with a lingering comp for 4 rounds Isilynor charges up to Kale and spell strikes with frosty magic hitting and dealing massive damage selenor steps up and smacks him good with his mace laucian rides lightning and crashes into dwarf archer who pops and disappears Allissee steps up and slices at kale Amar steps up and attacks and steps away cardigan steps up and attacks and pops a dwarf then moves to the next kale gets up quickly waves his sword and warps away
we carry on through the almost tunnel gaining elevation. laucian's elemental flys up to see out of the ravine / almost tunnel checking to see about the battle of one god fighting another god and being enprisoned. Ancient, can't know much about it. sometimes someone has sealed away in this stone.

we carry on following Ohst into the Fogpeak mountains. some of the tallest in the world. very cold and harsh. won't last long in the elements. perpetual fog. hostile to humanoids, and many monsters/creatures. the north wind comes alive, an evil spirit. how the legend is interpreted, no one ever reached the peak, fog gets you lost and you die from ice storms or ice boulders or other deadly things and here we are at the top of it. Not as cold as it could be, path seems to be snowless and is less cold. the only way to go really. we are in a nearly impossible spot to reach in normal circumstances.
a bull and 3 cows grazing and these bull-like creatures with bright red hair. they charge.
zutlieg makes everyone super and then warps to flank the bulls. they stink super bad and almost make zutlieg vomit. selenor steps up to flank the bulls and smacks one and kills a cow and another and makes an aura they are sorta tame cows
we carry on through some epic stuff in the high mountains. come around the mountain to see if we are reaching the peak. stars and moon are out. getting colder, less snow. carry on to see an 18-ish girl with long white hair and icicles hanging in it, looks human, but sitting in a strange unnatural meditation posture. selenor approaches and she could sense him. say hello and stands up quickly. asks if we have been following the path of the key. name is Colderanti says in a "not sure " way has lived her entire life selenor asks if she is a dragon she recommends we leave now. she is after the key heard things about who is trapped/buried in the mountain. the war was stopped by ancient wizards, who sealed the genie away. she will take his buried treasures and become super powerful she nicely smiles and transforms into a...
White Dragon flys up 30 feet up zutlieg masterfully performs to make everyone inspired and then hastes Amar, Isilynor casts a blaze of fire at it and it takes some damage dragon roars, but everyone shrugs it off and takes some epic damage from Amar dragon screeches and tries to fly away selenor jumps forward and rips out the inners of the dragon from below by charging forward looked up and throws a spear into the dragon's heart and it comes crashing down and then he breathes life back into the dragon, but she is already gone and died because of having her spirit ripped out. the dragon falls on selenor and takes a bunch of damage the Ancient Ice Dragon dies. Can't believe how fast she died. Must not have been a powerful dragon. She was young and inexperienced.
carry on to the peak of the mountain. that tells us the legend says the spirits say to be careful. afraid there is nothing more to track. you carry on what will wait for us for a time
selenor takes the wand

round the corner and see a sheet of ice, storms raging intensely, nowhere to go and nothing around. detect a powerful abjuration all around. Isilynor consults the spirits around everyone and keeps searching for something. Allissee detects magical force against her as she tries to cast a spell. we all pitch in to learn some occult knowledge the symbols glow out and the defences are lowered as she casts detect. the symbol emanates out. conjuration and detects it. the rune lords defeated this guy and put him here, the god thing, imprisoned him here.
the ice covering the boulder is thicker to the side facing the steps. it's thick. gets unfazed by fire. very powerful magic flowing through this boulder. a massive nexus point of magic. seems like the place to be, but will never break the ice. zutlieg determines that a way to open the ice is to have 7 shards, but we don't have 7... ice glowed when the crystal laucian presents Cardigan determining the symbol is a connection to a deity and what it has touched. this is forming a trifecta with ice and the wearer. a bridge between ice and the one wearing the symbol. zutlieg recalls the ages and this is age nine there was the age of dragons and the age of legends. gods need/want proper binding pacts with people. a primaeval nature needs truly devout followers. laucian puts the symbol in his hand and will assist us, but will not go forward. zutlieg snatches the symbol, but then hands it over to selenor. his hand begins to burn and he gives it back. zutlieg wants to perform, but Cardigan does not think he can trick the god. must be real zutlieg decides to give himself over to the god. cardigan says that a few months ago and unleashed something that caused destruction and a priest gave his life to destroy the creature. in return, Erastil made the priest a celestial stag and will live forever in the divine realm. takes an awesome beautiful longbow vibrating with primal energy. contains a shred of his being. She hands it to zutlieg who takes it and studies it. tones of carvings/etchings / potent magical oils keeping it awesome. zutlieg takes the bow and crystal and Cardigan shows him to the front of the ice and kneels. pulls up his sleeve. wait she says and runs down to the cows and comes back with a cow. She says to hunt the cow. zutlieg takes the magical bow and shoots the cow. bow warms. and Cardigan takes zutlieg to the cow and gives dagger and tells him to cut him up as she guides his hand to pull out the heart of the cow and which is the heart of the wilderness. zutlieg takes the heart in his left hand and the onyx dagger in right. "stab yourself carefully in the heart" Cardigan takes the dagger and takes two fingers and pushes in and blood of nature in one hand and blood of community in the other. Erastil loves these things. we learn he has existed watching and caring. a god who never accepts failure / giving up. fight to the bitter end looks at the ice and knows Erastil hates the god of destruction. zutlieg tells Erastil he pledges his life and joins the god. the illusion dissipates and the eyes of the mountain stag see him truly. zutlieg sees a tree man/ent covered in rot and decay. he speaks and implies mistakes have been made and must be fixed. some promises have been broken. hear scorch bark crumbles and falls apart to blue cold flames, ghost-like. he feels a connection to magic and rushes through for a call to the hunt to the summer lands, the power flowing through magic, a divine stag is judging me, the clone would be Runelord join the hunt". zutlieg has a heart-cut shade wound in his hand and his moustache has become almost real, magic is reflecting his true self. standing up with a rush of power feels like gaining new abilities. the hive in blood squeal and they are being cleansed out. zutlieg cleanses his blood in holy fire. becomes purified. takes a magical arrow from the magical quiver and shoots the magical arrow at the ice the ice shatters and beyond is a wooden door. old oak. symbol skull of Erastil, rough iron handle. zutlieg opens the door. hear the voice of a stag. Beware, prison is only one way. zutlieg and everyone steps through the door portal. teleport-like sensation to a different plane of reality. in a corridor 6m wide and 3 high. perfect straight, symmetrical ice stone bricks. goes down. move forward, left dead end. head to a door open to small courtyard walls up about 100 m with a perpetual cloud of ice and snow. Selenor knows this is an artificial plane. programs running. Zutlieg feels the ice and snow but feels cut off from nature. feels damp and pulls out a crystal symbol and moves forward to next door. hallway. door. another hall, but cracked and broken down. sharp ice. attempts to break in. held steady though. don't touch the sides. carrying on. proper cave room. some sort of symbol on the wall. walks over to investigate. shard glows and holds it up to the symbol. feeling magic pass through. zutlieg is accepted past. feel a sense of intrusion from the walls ice golems appear 2.
zutlieg very epically inspires everyone selenor steps up and attacks Isilinor steps up and strikes and kills the golems
I go forward to touch the sigil and open the portal. move forward. the corridor ends and there are spatters of blood on the floor. Follow the blood path for 10 mins. to find the body of a young man with black hair, in his early 20s 5;8" small moustache and double chin, a big forehead, a dark black top with a green shirt.

find out that he died of stabs from tiny little cuts all over. She performs an autopsy to find out and sees a creature pop out of the chest. Ice Zuggles are common on plains of ice. burrow into chests to lay eggs. Selenor destroys the Ice Zuggle brutally.
he finds a blue stone. nice looking. finds out it is also a fusion of alchemy. zutlieg identifies an ice orb. and uses his alchemical knowledge to learn to take chemical composition to make alchemical warp bombs. ice Zuggul orb is unlocked for the taking. zutlieg has the orb.
Amar loots the next corpse. and kicks it and it breaks the head off. gets a +1 shortsword thieves tool pouch with 1 gold and 5 silver, 2 healing potions minor.
zutlieg finds his way to a forest through nature to a double door. open and find yourself in an indoor ice crystal forest. infected by winter. ice crystals are biological ice constructs. see off in the distance. huge cavern with lots of exits. smoke off in the distance. see camp, tents attempting to grow shrubbery in ice dirt and mushrooms. makeshift tents and trees were cut down to make spike walls around the camp. mostly dwarves sheltering around being reached conditions. crying holding each other.
approaches, calling out to them in their language. they get scared but an old man comes forward. are you prisoners or wardens? no. we entered freely. looking for a man who stole the key. trying to save the village whose key has been stolen. been sent to return the one with the key. you are stuck forever. can you help us build up this camp? we destroyed golems. many ways into Yarl's prison. mostly all from planar rifts. bottom of mine takes us here. has seen nothing. zutlieg shows him his symbols.
an old man tells of a prison being guarded by nature. hot springs, eternal summer, peace. then she came, a woman. used ice magic to break the seal to seek a bargain with the trapped god. zutlieg gives them some alchemical items to help. he leads us along on the right path. a large passageway. steam bursting through. he warns us to be careful. it's too hot.
Zutlieg is priest of Aristil. almost high priest gaining new abilities.
I can flavour spells with the fluff of the hunt things when inspiring courage and whatnot. fluff it up with a hunting/survival/nature theme.
