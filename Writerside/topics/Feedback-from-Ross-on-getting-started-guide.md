## Feedback-from-Ross.

The biggest issue I had with the getting started guide is the layout, I think. 
Why have a 3 requirement titles, and also include the actual requirement as part of the title? 
There are also steps/topics that seem to be placed in nonsensical orders.
Topics are also wildly different lengths for no sane reason. 
I'll go through each topic and lay out my issues with them, then send what a revised starting guide might look like.

Welcome section
This one is actually pretty good, but maybe one paragraph instead of 4 separate lines?

Before we go any further.
These are pretty good things to include,
but can also mostly go into the content guide or the welcome section, making it redundant.

Step #0 content warning
(??? Where content warning??)

Unlocking the discord
(Ah, discord is the content warning, that is very fair)
Most new people are coming from the discord, is this section really that necessary?

Why did I add step 0?
You have zero reason to explain yourself; a content guide is very self-explanatory.

18+
Another redundant section, you can just say this under the requirements topic on the content guide.

What to do now?
Why is this not at the *end* of step 0?
That way, people don't have to remember to go *Back* to the discord link,
and can just to the discord right from the point that they decide they're okay with the content guide.

Content guide
Finally getting to the content guide that is mentioned half a page higher.

This link doesn't work well? 
It sends you to a guide on how to make an editable checklist. 
Why not change it to a link that shows the actual content guide checklist.

I think this could easily be a page one it is own, especially the way you have it set up. 

It's very fair to say "All of these things *can* happen in the campaign",
but I feel like it might violate the spirit of the content guide in a way?

A lot of these should also be justified, or at least elaborated upon.
"Sex between PCs", for example.

"Homophobia" is another that could be explained. 
Is your world openly discriminating against LGBT? Will every gay character face prosecution / social consequences? 
Is it only for specific places / regions / religions.

Real-world religion.
This will happen in the campaign?
I don't think Golarion has any real world religions?
Sexism, same as homophobia
Transphobia, same as homophobia
Specific cultural issues. Do you have any in mind? It's a *very* broad topic.

Mental and Physical health
For one, I find it hilarious that 'Thirst' is in the same category as 'freezing to death' and 'sexual assault'
Torture, Sexual assault, terrorism, Pregnancy, Miscarriage, Abortion. 
They Are all very controversial topics in the gaming space, 
so giving a brief explanation as to why you'd want them in your campaign would go a long way
to eliminate potential red flags from new players.

Permanent Character Death
No notes

Death of Significant NPCs?
No Notes

Slavery
This is a pretty good example of what you should do with the other controversial topics.

Comedy
No notes, but probably add that given the amount of Europeans in the group mild racism in the form of stereotype specific jokes.

Your guide also has no mentions of mental health issues like depression anxiety or disabilities. Might ruffle some feathers if it's not in the content guide but comes up in the campaign.

Suggestions.
Why constantly interrupt the starting guide with this. Leave a little note at the very bottom.

Telegram.
Good description, but you repeat the same line twice for some reason.

Discord.
Why is this step 2, when most of the people join *from* discord, and why is this a separate step from the telegram? 
More clunk.

Establishing the Character's Lore.
Spoiler warning is pretty good.

GitHub optional should be a note under the lore guide, not its own separate topic.

Learn the rules

Good introduction,

Paizo Variant rules
Good intro, good warnings.

Homebrew rule changes.
An excellent page, no notes.

Paizo Optional rules linked under the top 'Optional Rules', not buried in the homebrew rules page.

Talk to me
This should either be the last step below the character creation guide, or the first step, Putting it in the middle is strange.

Make the Character. 
This category, all about the rules and how build a character within the rules, is below the rule 
changes?
Strange choice IMO.
Those next to the 3rd party content, would be a better fit.

3rd party content. Why is there a link to a pathbuilder guide first, unrelated to the topic title? Move it to the pathbuild topic. 
Not only that, but you have two links that do the same thing? one in github and one in notion?

Pathbuilder 2e.

Setup link at the front is strange, because why do you have a link to a set up guide before a link to the actual app? All the info in this topic is just a repeat on what is in notion. Get rid of the notion link.

Pick your equipment.
Good Stuff
Feat, races, items, spells don't have any entries in the spreadshet. Even a simple "All races regardless of rarity" in their specific page is enough, or get rid of the page entirely.

Bro just complete the list there's only 206 of them, and most of them are common

Buy the full version.
Why is this not at the top of the pathbuilder topic to be said while introducing pathbuilder itself?


Foundry.
My brother in christ. Why are you linking a chrome download link before even introducing what the hell foundry is.

What is the Forge?
Why are you introducing the hosting service before introducing Foundry?

Join the Forge Campaign.
No notes

Request a foundry user
No notes
Log into foundry
Why do you have two of the same links.
These four steps are far too small to be separate topics.

Install Foundry
Once you have a forge account, it is just as simple as logging into the forge, and clicking the campaign.
Why are people losing the links or the links breaking?

Pick your player colour
Does this really need to be its own separate step?

Request a character sheet
Good
Open your character sheet.
Import your character to foundry
These can just all be one topic
Pick a token image
Send the token Image
Token setup
These all should all just be in the same topic.


What you need to know.
This is good.

Everything might be ready.
Not a bad checklist.
Additional reading
There really is no need to re link this link.

# Most important things to have when joining this campaign

You are 18+
You have the commitment to play a long term year+ long campaign.
You are comfortable with the Campaign Content Guide
[[Link to content guide in separate page]]

If you are okay with all of this, Congrats! You are welcome to play with us!

# The Next few steps will take you through Character creation and joining the next Session.


## Required Apps
We use Telegram for most text communication, Discord for Calls and sessions, and Foundry VTT via The Forge for character/combat. There are no paywalls, but you will need accounts for all three apps. DM on telegram for Forge link, and I'll set up your character sheet and user!
Here is the telegram group link [[Telegram link]]
Here is the discord group link [[Discord group]]
During any point in the character creation process, feel free to reach out to me via telegram (I rarely check discord) to ask questions or for help to build up your character. I happen to be rather scattered so feel free to shout at me, or to threaten me with large sticks. Alternatively, offer French Toast.

## Character Creation
You can use pathbuilder to help you create a character which is highly recommended if you're a new player, as Pathfinder 2e is a big system and it's easy to miss steps.  Some optional rules are behind a paywall, which is WELL worth paying for and if you plan on making any amount of pf2e characters, you *will* get your monies worth! but don't worry if you don't pay it. You can see all the rules and options we use in pathbuilder here [[Pathbuilder 2e Setup]]

### Optional Rules

Here's a full list [[Optional Rules]] and here's a list of all the 3rd party content with use [[3d party content]]
We use a lot of optional rules for creating our characters.
But the biggest ones are Dual Classing, Free Archetype, and Stamina
Here's a link to all the Rarity things that are unlocked [[Rarity Lock Status]]

### Starting Items
We use the standard equipment starting table.

### Character Lore
I have also created a long 'checklist' to help you create your character. Filling out all of these headings will create a fairly fleshed out character, and make it easier to introduce you to the world!
I also use a system of Plot Threads that you make during character creations. These are kind of the path you want your character to take, or what you want to happen to your character, usually tied to your backstory or character development.

I use github (as you can see) to keep track of my notes, and since it's free and hosted online, it's an easy way to keep your notes too. Here's a short tutorial [[github setup guide]]

## Setting up in foundry
In foundry you can send me a picture of what your character will look like and I can set you up a token with vision. I can use path muncher to import your character from pathbuilder, but that sometimes breaks so be sure to double check everything! Here is a short tutorial on using the basic features of foundry [[tutorial link]]

## Finishing Touches

Here is a campaign recap [[Recap Link]] so you know what all has happened in the world before you joined the campaign. Here's some tools and pages that can help you out [[Other Starting Things]]
