Path Wars, [07/09/2025 15:26]
2. We have completed 5% of Magni Watch! :D

Path Wars, [07/09/2025 15:26]
Please decide what you do on your day off (downtime).

Path Wars, [07/09/2025 17:55]
What next? :)

Path Wars, [07/09/2025 18:04]
Remy:
"Magic rabbits.
Never been so hostile before."

Path Wars, [07/09/2025 18:36]
So what next? :)

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [07/09/2025 22:52]
Drugs

Whoever wants to join in is welcome, Nadya is doing some crafting of alchohol or flayleaf

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [07/09/2025 22:52]
After fighting a whole zoo she just wants to relax

Antoine / Anthony = Allisee, [07/09/2025 23:25]
Training

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [07/09/2025 23:39]
Machiq will head to the guards and sue Remy for damages on account of negligence.

Path Wars, [07/09/2025 23:40]
Awesome ideas :)

Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW, [08/09/2025 01:10]
Lysandra will join in with the training

Path Wars, [08/09/2025 01:19]
Sure! What kind of training do you undertake? :)

Antoine / Anthony = Allisee, [08/09/2025 01:25]
Gijo will propose to train Judo with Lysandra.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [08/09/2025 18:55]
Akuma will spend the day practicing his stances and working primarily on his grip, which was such a problem the day before.

Path Wars, [08/09/2025 19:36]


Path Wars, [08/09/2025 19:36]
^ If anyone wants to do one of these, you can.

Path Wars, [08/09/2025 19:36]
Does the group do anything socially together?

Path Wars, [08/09/2025 19:36]
Perhaps dinner? Drinks? Etc?

Revan | Anthony (not french) | SF Lysae Lysandra #4 MW, [08/09/2025 19:37]
Lysandra will do her best, but it’s quickly clear she’s better with her swords. Centaur bodies just aren’t built for it.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [08/09/2025 19:39]
((Akuma will join in drinks and dinner if offered, otherwise he tries to remain respectful by not automatically including himself.
Also, I would suppose the practice could count as "Exercise"))

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [08/09/2025 19:52]
I figure Nadya will continue the now 2 day old tradition of drinks at a bar after patrol. As far as shes concerned, anyone who comes with for drinks is the people shes interested in hanging out with anyway.

Antoine / Anthony = Allisee, [08/09/2025 20:32]
"Do not be bothered too much if you don't manage to get it. Your body has other advantages, you can perform trampling charges and deliver powerful kicks as well as having better balance than 2 legged humanoids"

Path Wars, [09/09/2025 11:51]
So who would like their night + day off handled first?

Path Wars, [09/09/2025 11:51]
Also, we will be having a day off every time we complete 5% of the campaign, at minimum.

Eimer Hone, [09/09/2025 19:02]
Zilde will also join in with training. Then she will go visit her father and tell him about the adventures the group has been on so far

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 13:11]
^

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 15:39]
OK, I will go one at a time.

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 16:07]
^ What training?

Antoine / Anthony = Allisee, [12/09/2025 16:07]
.

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 16:07]
^ Ok, Machiq, do you head to the Arvensoar?

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 16:07]
Ok, you go to the Arvensoar with Lysandra and do judo. Anything else?

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 16:08]
You spend time in the Avensoar with the other two.

Antoine / Anthony = Allisee, [12/09/2025 16:08]
This counts as an exercise hobby right?

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 16:08]
It is obvious and known the group are heading to the pub.

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 16:09]
The tipsy tengu.

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 16:09]
Yes.

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [12/09/2025 16:18]
(What's the Arvensoar?)

Antoine / Anthony = Allisee, [12/09/2025 16:33]
(Probably the guard HQ)

Path Wars, [12/09/2025 16:42]
It is the grand guard station.

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [12/09/2025 16:45]
Yes, Machiq goes there

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [12/09/2025 16:54]
Akuma will head to the Tipsy Tengu after his exercise.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [12/09/2025 19:59]
I imagine somewhere in lowcleft. Maybe just wandering around the neighborhood or hopping between establishments. Probably a lazy snaking path that ends up at the Tipsy Tengu for the aforementioned drinks.

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:25]

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:32]
@ArtyArtillery

Do you have Magnimar lore?

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:33]
@Askarans

You head to the Arvensoar.

After talking to some guards, you are directed to an office.

Within the office is a dwarf looking through a filing cabinet, he is....wait, he's asleep standing up in full armour!

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:33]
Gijō, Lysandra and Zilde you train together.

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:34]
Zilde, you walk from the Arvensoar to your house.

It is close by.

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:35]
You arrive at your cosy stone house.

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:36]
Zilde, you make your way through the hallway, removing your armoured sabatons.

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:37]
Your father sits at the kitchen table, the room is dark in the evening light, a single ever burning candle lighting the room.

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:37]
James Darkmoon is reading a letter that was sealed with the sigil of Cheliax.

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [14/09/2025 16:53]
"Sir? Sir! You have a guest!" Machiq shouts loudly.

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:53]
The dwarf shakes his head.

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:54]
The old old old dwarf looks at you.

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:54]
Sergeant Moldun Ollo:
"Sergeant Moldun Ollo, and you are....?"

Path Wars, [14/09/2025 16:55]
@HistoricallyInaccurate

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [14/09/2025 16:58]
Machiq clears his throat. "Machiq Nirama. My name is Machiq Nirama. I'm the owner of a gunsmithy. I want to report that my store was destroyed because Zoo Animals got loose and one of them ransacked my shop."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [14/09/2025 18:19]
aye. Art, Underworld, and Magnimar

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 01:25]
Sergeant Moldun Ollo:
"Huh, lad are you the one that helped the Magni Watch at the zoo?"

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 01:29]
You have 3 choices.

Shore, Summit or Shadow.

Shore is where you work, you'll find sailors and working class smoking weed, doing coke, etc in this area.

Summit is high-class; you could use your guard status to enter some prestigious drug dens.

Shadow: lawless, crack dens, depraved, but also a lot of psychedelics.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 01:39]
Easy shadow for Nadya

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 01:39]
That's what she's used to

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 01:39]
Bonus to Underworld lore?

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 01:43]
+6

Antoine / Anthony = Allisee, [16/09/2025 01:43]
(Only +3 int?)

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 01:44]
You are aware that going any deeper into the shadow than the outer areas where it meets the dockway will lead to almost certain death.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 01:44]
You will be stabbed, eaten or lost forever...

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 01:46]
I figure Nadya has been around in Magnimar long enough to have enough close calls to know not to venture toooooo far alone. From before she was a guard, she must have had a few hangouts that were (relatively) safe enough

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 01:49]
You go into a local crack house and a *very* hairy fetchling stands behind a small room behind a desk.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 01:49]
The only thing else in this room is another door just next to the desk.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 01:50]
The hairy fetchling is scratching his neck and his blood shot eyes dart at you, immediately he draws a dagger:
"What brings a guard to my den?"

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 01:57]
"Eh?"

Nadya looks down at her uniform.

"Oh, right."

She shapechanges to her pale redheaded human 'tailless form' and begins to unbutton the jacket.

"Sorry. It's been a rough few months. They've got me actually wearing the damn thing, in daylight no less."

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 02:53]
The hairy fetchling recognises you:
"Ahhh, a fellow worm burrowed out of the dirt, saw the sun and now misses the taste of filth."

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 02:54]
The hairy fetchling indicates you can follow him through the door.

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [16/09/2025 04:47]
"Wha- how did you?" Machiq is a bit surprised on how he could know when, to his knowledge, he should be the first one here. But then he remembers the badges.
He scratched his head.
"Oh- ah. Yes. I helped them. But I'm here, because I want my damages to my shop reconsolidated. I want to sue the Zoo for the damages that their animals has caused as their negligent care allowed animals to escape and rampage throughout the city."
Machiq points to the scar on his neck.
"That's what one of the animals did to me here as well."

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:15]
Sergeant Moldun Ollo smiles softly, the old dwarf strokes his beard:
"Oh do you now?
Sue the zoo.

Now, do you know who owns the zoo by any chance?

I'll tell you: the mayor.

Do you know how much the legal fees would cost?

The danger to your reputation...or your life?

Do you know anyone on the court of justice? On the council of ushers?"

The old dwarf has woken up and is taking you seriously, but also raises many points of why that may not be so possible.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:18]
@ArtyArtillery

Follow him?

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 06:18]
Aye

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:19]
The hairy fetchling leads you into a following room.

It is a mine-shaft-style life.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:21]
The hairy fetchling pulls a lever, a series of gears and runes lowers the lift down several floors.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:23]
The hairy fetchling, introducing himself as Shackle flips the switch, the lift stops in front of a door.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:23]
Shackle opens the door, several figures are sitting on cushions in this long thin stone room.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:24]
A couple of small smokeless braziers keep the room warm.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:24]
Shackle gets you a clean cushioned space.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:25]
Shackle:
"Smoke, eat, inject?"

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 06:29]
"It's gonna be smoke today. I had to fight an entire zoo of crap. City's not supposed to have ankhrav in it but some rich fuck has to ruin things with his weird pets."

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:30]
Shackle:
"Free on charge of keeping the light from the dark spaces....?"

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:30]
Shackle says this as a question.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 06:34]
"Just because they're making me walk around upstairs doesn't change the deal, Shackle."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 06:35]
"If the guard shows up down here, it won't be because of me. You're performing a necessary task for society to function as far as I see it."

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:36]
Shackle smiles and scratches his hair neck (already red raw from scratching).

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:36]
Shackle nods enthusiastly.

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 06:37]
Shackle hands you a dark black genie's lamp.

Faint wisps of white smoke escape from the lamp's tip.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 06:44]
Nadya is gonna settle down comfortably and examine the lamp.

"What have we here, exactly? This keleshite or something?"

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 07:24]
Shackle:
"Doctor's newest experience."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/09/2025 07:33]
Amused by the presentation, Nadya takes a hit.

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [16/09/2025 07:48]
"Well, the law should be blind to who exactly the person is, only the crimes commited. No matter whether it's the mayor, a guard, a poor old gun smith, or a man who just lost his home. But I have experienced time and time again that the laws here aren't as forward as I'm used to from my home."

Machiq sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose briefly.

"In that case, I'll go a step down and sue Remy, the zoo director, as the zoo is at his direct responsibility."

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 19:52]
Sergeant Moldun Ollo seems intrigued:
"A good fighter and a strong sense of justice."

Sergeant Moldun Ollo pauses and says:
"We can't fix your shop.
We can't fix your life nor probably the divide between the common man and the elite.
But...."

He pauses a second and says:
"Have you ever considered a job in law enforcement?"

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [16/09/2025 22:05]
Machiq laughs. "Hah. That's a bold suggestion. If you can't defeat them, become them?"
The ratfolk steps up and down the room.
"It's gonna cost alot of gold for me to rebuild my shop, get the metals back,. some things even were very difficult to make..."
Machiq looks  sternly towards Sergeant Moldun.
"What you are saying that you see no chance for me to even get a copper?"

Path Wars, [16/09/2025 22:22]
Sergeant Moldun Ollo looks grim:
"Such a thing is unlikely...

But being a guard *can* be very profitable."

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [16/09/2025 23:14]
Machiq sighs.
"Are you that desperate?"
After a brief pause he says: "Well, I guess.. I need to get some money. Count.. count me in."

Path Wars, [17/09/2025 00:05]
The dwarf hands you the uniform, a badge, has you sign a contract and he falls asleep on his feet.

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [18/09/2025 20:18]
"Uh..."
Machiq is perplexed about that.. "One way to get a job.." he sighs in exasperation.
Disappointed, and frustrated about the outcome he hoped for being smashed down like this, he leaves the office, slamming the door.

Path Wars, [18/09/2025 20:30]
As the smoke swirls in your lungs, your mind goes into free fall.

You stand atop a mountain looking down at a tunnel system of which you can fly through.

One of the openings of this honeycomb tunnel system glows with the same smoky white and black light.

You fly, projecting yourself down the hole.

Along the tunnel's walls are a variety of imagery.

The cards of the harrow, but with each of the characters replaced with a draconic equivalent: The Dragon Prince, The Dragon Throne, etc.

As you delve deeper, you find yourself filled with adrenaline.

Pillars of flame sprout from the cave walls: Green Flame and Grey Flame light your way down.

Purple tendrils sprout from the walls, threatening to grab you.

A section of the cave is made of wood, sprouting with swamp moss, with the dead bodies of imps rotting, an impossibility.

A normal section of the cave has strong winds and birds made of stone and clockwork.

Other deeper features of the cave's walls seem uncertain, in flux.

The tunnel finally opens out into a much, much larger space.

Hundreds of bodies lay littered about this space.

A large white portal, hundreds of metres tall, hundreds of metres wide.

You tepidly step into it.

You didn't want to.

But...you had to.

You find yourself standing on the walls of a city.

Not Magnimar.

A city of black and red.

A burnt city: burning once more.

The flames of war engulf the city.

You look at your paws, and they are slick with blood.

You have an ungodly wave of bliss, as you walk through streets of death your mind is alight with pleasure, the high last for what feels like days.

In reality mere hours passed as you awaken in the pillowed chamber.

Your body wet with sweat, your mind feels sluggish as you shake away the lingering magical chemistry.

Path Wars, [18/09/2025 20:32]
Sergeant Moldun Ollo smiles in his sleep, still standing up.

Path Wars, [18/09/2025 20:32]
@HistoricallyInaccurate

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [19/09/2025 02:57]
Nadya lounges for several minutes, staring up at the ceiling and occasionally attempting to scrawl illusory symbols in the air with a figment spell. It takes her a few tries to get the magic to form anything coherent. Afterwards, she fumbles around in her backpack for her waterskin and takes several long drinks from it. Stowing the waterskin, she fetches some plain clothing from the pack as well and changes out of the sweat-soaked guard uniform. Finally, as she leaves the room and heads towards the exit, Nadya extracts a sizable bit of flayleaf from her backpack and begins to pack it into her pipe.

Path Wars, [19/09/2025 07:45]
As you leave, Shackles hands you a black envelope with the red wax crest of Cheliax.

Path Wars, [19/09/2025 07:45]
Shackles:
"You have a letter.
They knew you were here."

Path Wars, [19/09/2025 07:45]
Shackles stress itches.

Path Wars, [19/09/2025 07:45]
Shackles:
"How could they know?"

Path Wars, [19/09/2025 07:45]
Shackles also says:
"And... How was the experience?"

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [19/09/2025 07:51]
"Huh. Great is Asmodeus, I guess. Its funny, actually. Normally its speak of devil and he shall appear. This time I only just thought about 'em."

Nadya takes the envelope and tucks it into a shirt pocket.

"Because, that... whatever it was, made me feel like a duke of Hell. Like I was Bifrons or something. Maybe its just because violence is on my mind recently, maybe its just how that stuff is. Maybe its just because of the special relationship I have with blood, i dunno. I thought it was alright, but other folks might be scared off by that kind of stuff."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [19/09/2025 08:11]
"As for how they found me... I mean, if this seal is legitimate, I wouldn't want to know if I was you. Probably dangerous to know too much. Probably shouldn't ask too many questions about it."

Path Wars, [19/09/2025 14:30]
Shackles nods and speaks no more.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [19/09/2025 18:25]
Nadya leans forward with a smile.

"Good. Till next time, then."

She heads out and makes her way down the street to find an empty spot of town with fewer eyes before pulling out the letter and cracking the seal.

Path Wars, [19/09/2025 21:56]
The letter explains that you have been invited to Paracountess Zarta Dralneen's garden party to celebrate the graduation of her pupil.

- you are being invited due to being a city officer.

- mandatory attendance.

You will know that to not attend is .... Not recommended.

Also your comrades will be there.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [19/09/2025 22:47]
Nadya sighs with relief - a mandatory party is one of the less dangerous things to come in a letter with a seal like that. She tucks the letter back into her bag and begins to head off towards the Tipsy Tengu.

Path Wars, [21/09/2025 19:53]
@HistoricallyInaccurate

Path Wars, [21/09/2025 19:54]
Besides Zilde EvenGuard is everyone else handled?

Path Wars, [23/09/2025 05:26]
It's been 7 days since this message.

I'll give @HistoricallyInaccurate 3 days.

Eimer Hone, [24/09/2025 06:40]
“Hello father. Everything ok?”

Path Wars, [24/09/2025 08:08]
James Darkmoon looks up at you, his slick black hair starkly different from your own bright hair:
"Ah, daughter.
Good evening.
How fairs your training?
I heard from many a source that you fought valiantly for the past few days."

Your father looks down at the letter and continues to read.

Eimer Hone, [24/09/2025 08:11]
“Indeed. Some interesting fights. The team becoming more resilient guards by each fight.”

Path Wars, [24/09/2025 08:15]
James Darkmoon doesn't look up this time:
"I am sure your mother would have been proud..."

James pauses and says:
"This letter is an invitation to a garden party by a dangerous and powerful woman.
You and I are both invited, not as guests but as guards.
Your group is not ready for this assignment, but it is out of my hands."

Path Wars, [29/09/2025 09:51]
James Darkmoon:
"I'm going to round up your friends."

Eimer Hone, [03/10/2025 16:03]
"I'm sure we are father. I'll come too" Zilde sighs from disappointment

Path Wars, [04/10/2025 01:02]
James Darkmoon quickly says:
"No no no.
You stay here.
Uh, rest and prepare yourself."

James Darkmoon stands up, putting the letter into his spacious pouch, strides across the room with great speed and before you get much of a chance to think, he is out of the room, out of the house.

Path Wars, [04/10/2025 01:03]
@HistoricallyInaccurate

Zilde, your father did not seem to want for you to come with him / spend time with him.

Path Wars, [04/10/2025 01:04]
@ArtyArtillery

Nadya, as you walk through the dockway, appearing from just out of your eye line is a well known guard captain: James Darkmoon.

You may have seen him before but he is own to keeping to himself and being VERY dedicated to his work.

Path Wars, [04/10/2025 01:06]
James Darkmoon's dark hair and pale white skin, broad shoulders and piercing gaze is unsettling and intense...yet...there's something a bit familiar about it.

Perhaps you've met one of his relatives.

James Darkmoon:
"You are Nadya.
Correct?
You'll have received your letter by now.
Come with me."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [04/10/2025 01:09]
"Captain!" Nadya exclaims with some surprise at being approached. "I'm needed now?"

Path Wars, [04/10/2025 01:21]
James Darkmoon replies with very little emotion:
"Yes.
Prepare for the garden party.
Go to this address now."

James Darkmoon hands you a map and a piece of paper with an address:
"This is my house.
Zilde is there.
Prepare.
I shall fetch the others."

Path Wars, [04/10/2025 01:21]
James Darkmoon immediately walks off, goes to the Arvensoar and gets the others.

James Darkmoon walks to his house with the rest of the party.

Path Wars, [04/10/2025 01:22]
@ArtyArtillery

Do you do anything?

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [04/10/2025 01:24]
Nadya heads to the house as directed, although she's in a foul mood when she arrives since her night out has been called off.

Path Wars, [04/10/2025 01:25]
@HistoricallyInaccurate

Cannon arrives at your house.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [04/10/2025 01:35]
Nadya despondently nods as a greeting. "Hey."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [04/10/2025 01:54]
"I'm gonna go try and wash my uniform. It's still gross and sweaty from, uh, the whole zoo thing. Captain should be around soon with the rest of us."

Eimer Hone, [04/10/2025 18:38]
Zilde gives a half hearted smile. “Hi. Yes do want you need to do.”

Zilde goes back into a state of confusion from the sudden behaviour from her father.

Path Wars, [09/10/2025 01:36]
James Darkmoon arrives at the Arvensoar, gathers the rest of the group and everyone is reunited at Zilde's house.

Path Wars, [09/10/2025 02:13]
James Darkmoon:
"As you have all received your letter, there is a garden party on tonight.

Your group are acting as.... extra security.

The reason behind this is...."

James Darkmoon seems to think for a moment and say:
"A somewhat political power play.

Just to be clear:
- there won't be any issues tonight.
- any issues would be greatly outside your capabilities.
- and...."

James Darkmoon sighs:

"....and you'll all need to wear guard suitwear and dressware.

I have Magni-Watch versions of both in the armoury downstairs.

Feel free to pick whatever one suits you best, there are a couple slightly different colour and appearance variations.

And whenever your all ready I shall escort us to the Alabaster district."

Path Wars, [09/10/2025 02:14]
As James Darkmoon speaks, his quiet voice lands upon the ears as loud and clearly heard.

James Darkmoon oozes an authority that is impossible to resist.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [09/10/2025 17:00]
Akuma gives a salute to the Captain before heading downstairs. He does glance at the rest of the squad to see if they are just as puzzled as he is regarding their assignment and lack of details, but figures they would be able to talk about it later.

It takes a bit for him to find an outfit that fits his frame while at the same time not making him look like a part of the entertainment for the evening.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [10/10/2025 05:56]
Down in the armory, Nadya is already in the process of fitting herself and will offer to help other folks getting into their new, fancy uniforms. She looks about as out of place as she possibly could wearing the ceremonial dress.

Eimer Hone, [12/10/2025 16:32]
Before going downstairs to get armour, Zilde turns to her father, “What is it. What do you think we aren’t capable of?”

Path Wars, [14/10/2025 01:13]
James Dark-moon:
"There is much that you are not ready for.
You are rank 1 guards.
You can only handle extremely minor threats.
You... you."

James Dark-Moon seems to break his monotone attitude, losing his cool.

Path Wars, [14/10/2025 01:13]
James Dark-Moon:
"You need more training and more time."

Path Wars, [16/10/2025 05:45]
James Dark-moon:
"Are you all ready to go to the event?"

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [16/10/2025 06:04]
"I suppose I'm not going to get more ready."

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [16/10/2025 21:22]
Akuma turns about with his arms outspread, both looking to see if everything looks in place while also presenting to those around him.
"I think it fits." He says, with a bit of hesitation in his voice. He has never worn anything worth even half as much as this outfit.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:17]
James Dark-Moon seems satisfied that you are all ready.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:17]
And a carriage takes the group up the seacleft cliff.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:17]
Across the city.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:17]
And to the Alabaster district.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:18]
The Magni Watch arrive at a large manor house, the house is black and red in colour.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:26]
It is regal yet daunting.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:26]
The sounds of music is heard.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:26]
Classical music, a string quartet.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:27]
LOTS of people are going back and forth through the garden path around the manor.

Path Wars, [18/10/2025 23:27]
You follow James Dark-Moon.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 18:59]
There are hundreds of people here.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 18:59]
All wearing lavish dresses and crisp suits.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:00]
Long tables stretch across the garden.

Each table is covered in a blood-red silken tablecloth.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:01]
Atop each table is far more expensive food and wine than any of you could consume over several days.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:02]
James Dark Moon gives you patrol areas, gives you instructions on when to check in and general advice and information.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:03]
As the night starts to really begin and even more people arrive, you see a familiar face: Viole of the Heroes of Magnimar!

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:05]
And alongside Viole are the other Heroes of Magnimar.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:06]
Does anyone approach the heroes?

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:06]
If not, I'll be progressing the story now.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:10]
You are all busy with guard duty so we can have the conversations (if any) retroactively.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:43]
@Linksanelf2006
Akuma.

As you patrol the grounds of the mansion, you hear the sounds of Tian Xia string music.

You are reminded of home.

Of Ba-Ming.

Of....

The illusion is broken, you snap back into reality.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:43]
Near your foot, just poking out of a bush is a rat.

The rat looks at you Akuma, the scurries into the bush.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:46]
Meanwhile...

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:47]
For 2 hours, the heroes of Magnimar seem to be looking around the grounds, doing a variety of magical channeling and searching.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:48]
They receive a few strange looks.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:50]
For 3 hours after that, the hero you recognise as Allisee is brewing something called "Unity Tea".

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:50]
You are each passed a cup.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:53]


Path Wars, [19/10/2025 19:54]
This woman approaches you.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:39]
Paracountess Zarta Dralneen:
"Welcome, welcome to my estate.

I am Paracountess Zarta Dralneen."

Paracountess Zarta Dralneen then courtesies.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:39]
Paracountess Zarta Dralneen insists you all try the unity tea and James Dark-Moon cautiously agrees.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:40]
James Dark-Moon:
"The Paracountress and I have some items of business to discuss, continue your guard."

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:42]
James Dark-Moon goes off with the Paracountess.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:43]
As you all enjoy your tea and continue your guard, nothing much happens...for a bit.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:44]
@ArtyArtillery

Nadya

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:45]
Nadya, you see Allisee and man walk off.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:45]


Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:47]
The man is covered in thick padded leather.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:47]
...and nothing happens for about 20 minutes.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:48]
Time stop at 10th level is cast.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:48]
The Magni Watch do not realise it but events are happening beyond what they witness.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:49]
Time unfreezes.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:50]
The heroes of Magnimar stand, a little out of breath and visibly injured.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:51]
There are piles of ash and a couple of strange gemstones laying in the ash.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:53]
In this garden is a bronze orb thing.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:53]
It's a decoration.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:53]
You would never really pay much attention to it.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:55]
It glows and everyone, *everyone* at the party becomes stunned.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:55]
Even the protector Magnimar Jyronn Immikar and the great mages of the Golemworks, they are all stunned.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:56]
@Linksanelf2006

Akuma is frozen, but you feel no pain and suffer no adverse effects.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:57]
Around 1,000 people collapse.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:57]
Black and green veins spread across people's bodies; they twist and contort on the ground.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 20:58]
This includes the members of the Magni Watch.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:00]
@HistoricallyInaccurate

Zilde Even-Guard.

Your eyes are closing, your life as you know it, fading.

You see a figure sprinting towards you, his black hair catches the light of the moon, he is screaming, but your hearing has already stopped working.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:01]
@HistoricallyInaccurate

You can make our parts of his yelling:

"Won't", "Again", "Please."

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:01]
@Askarans

The poison hurts Machiq particularly; it is not clear why.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:03]
Changer is not moving; the stone of his body glows intensely as if trying to absorb the energies of this magic, but just being completely unable to do so.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:13]
@Linksanelf2006

Akuma, like I said, you are not overly affected by whatever is happening.

You see James Dark-Moon run up to Zilde Even-Guard, genuinely scared.

He prays, channelling magic and something happens.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:16]
The only person deeply injured was Allisee, she stands, blood dripping, flesh broken.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:17]


Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:41]
Viole comes over to James Dark-Moon, the two of them cast something on the Magni Watch.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:41]
The party pass out, but none of you are dead.

Path Wars, [19/10/2025 21:42]
- 45ish hours later -

Path Wars, [20/10/2025 06:22]
The group awakens.

Path Wars, [20/10/2025 06:22]
You are all very sore.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [20/10/2025 16:17]
Taking a deep, heavy breath, Akuma sighs softly at the fond memories. He see the rat rush off into the bushes, and he finds it odd that such an upstanding place would have rodents, though he admits he has no idea of the actual care that was taken for this event.

He does find himself doing a quick investigation just to see if this rat problem is an actual problem or not.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [20/10/2025 16:21]
Akuma finds himself lurching forward to aid however he can, but the moment fades as he loses consciousness.

When he awakes, he feels his muscles screaming, as if he had just finished a hard day of training. He looks around to assess. Where is he? Where is everyone else? How many died while he was out? These are all thoughts that cross his mind.

Path Wars, [20/10/2025 23:25]
You are correct, it is strange.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:00]
You have awoken in a stone room; the ceiling is made of glass, and it is around dusk.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:00]
The room is relatively bright thanks to the ceiling.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:01]
A mechanical clock on the wall says the time is around 18:00.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:09]


Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:09]
You are all lying on beds.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:14]
You each have a green & black scar somewhere on your bodies.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:14]
You survived the soul poising but... just barely.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:18]
There is an elven woman in the room.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:26]


Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:27]
@Linksanelf2006

Your mark is in the vague shape of a rat.

It does not hurt, unlike the marks of the others.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:35]
The elf is too buried in her notes and clipboard to notice you all stirring.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:36]
After a few seconds, she glances up.

Not to look at you all, but to note the time from the clock.

She looks down at her clipboard quickly.

Then looks up at you all, her eyes tell you that she is very surprised.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:39]
The elf says:

"Your....you're alive."

She starts making notes with a pen, writing quickly and without stopping, says:

"We didn't think you'd ever wake.

The others certainly didn't.

Soul poisoning like that is very rare, way beyond our abilities to treat.

You're all very lucky to be alive.

The marks are persistent. The poison is halted. The marks won't go away until the curse has fully gone away.

Sister Miravelle has been praying to Sarenrae for just under 48 hours with barely any breaks."

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:40]
The elf continues:

"Perhaps Miravelle's prayers came true.

Though I'd say it has probably as much to do with the attention Viole and Captain Dark-Moon has been giving you.

Sorry, that's General Viole Jule Grace, titles and all that...

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:41]
The elf looks at you all now, up from her clipboard:

"I am Koriah Sunstrike.

Any questions?"

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [21/10/2025 03:44]
Machiq groans and holds his head as if he just had his worst hangover. He blinks, pinching his eyes, slowly adjusting to the light before he opens them.
"Wha- what happened?"

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 03:47]
Koriah Sunstrike opens one of the many books clipped to her belt, reads an entry and says:
"During a party held at Paracountress Zarta Dralneen's house, you were poisoned.

It is believed this was an attempt by the Korvosian state to significantly weaken the city before war breaks out."

Koriah Sunstrike looks at you Machiq and says plainly:
"They succeeded.
1,000 people are unconscious.
The heroes of Magnimar, the defenders of the city Selenor and Allisee are believed to have some level of involved."

Koriah Sunstrike looks a bit sheepish and says:
"They brewed and handed out the poisoned tea....."

Then  Koriah Sunstrike quickly adds:
"Uh, allegedly."

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [21/10/2025 04:44]
"1000... unconscious?" Akuma twists himself up into a sitting position. "Any deaths?"

He rubs the rat-like mark, curious of what it is. "A spell was cast. A powerful one. Does anyone have any leads on that?"

He has so many questions, but he tries to limit them to not pressure Koriah.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [21/10/2025 05:57]
Nadya lies flat and tries to pull a pillow over her eyes with a groan.

"Yeah. I am debatably alive. I suppose it's good to confirm I have a soul to be poisoned in the first place. Horrible, awful, headache-inducing method of finding out, however."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [21/10/2025 06:19]
She sighs and rolls over, pressing her head into the bed.

"If Little Cheliax wants to invade, of course it would start at a garden party... Rich cultists, all of 'em. That spell, though, I can almost taste it still. Practically no one can use spellcraft that strong."

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 07:59]
Koriah Sunstrike looks a bit awkward:
"Not...dead. Exactly."

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 22:39]
Koriah Sunstrike looks even more awkward and reads directly from her clipboard:
"Amar Rookmoon was vaporised instantly.
Mechanism origin unclear.
Daemonic magic was nearly definitely used.
Harrowers across Varisia have reported their magical capabilities becoming weaker and more unstable."

Koriah Sunstrike takes a deep breath as she finishes.

Path Wars, [21/10/2025 22:43]
Koriah Sunstrike nods and is about to reply to Cannon when the door at the end of the hall slams open.

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [21/10/2025 22:59]
Machiq begins to sit up and look at himself, especially there were the wound still hurts.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:31]
The heavy wooden door at the end of the hall slams open with enough force to make Koriah flinch and nearly drop her clipboard.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:32]
Captain James Darkmoon strides in, his usually immaculate uniform dishevelled and wrinkled.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:32]
Dark circles shadow his eyes, and stubble marks his jaw.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:32]
Clear signs he hasn't slept in days.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:33]
This is not the composed captain you got dressed with at his house before the party. .

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:33]
This man looks like he's been through hell

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:33]
Behind him, a half-elven woman enters with a predator's grace, her wide-brimmed hat casting dramatic shadows across her tattooed features.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:33]
Unlike Darkmoon, she appears alert and focused, sharp eyes already cataloging every detail of the room with practiced efficiency.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:33]
Darkmoon stops abruptly when he sees you conscious and sitting up.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:34]
His shoulders sag with visible relief, and for a moment, the captain (who is also Zilde's father) looks like he might actually break down.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:35]
James Darkmoon moves closer to the beds, his exhausted gaze sweeping over each of you.

He is visibly lingering on the green and black scars.

His eyes find Zilde among you, and something raw and vulnerable crosses his face.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:35]
The half-elf leans against the doorframe, arms crossed, watching the reunion with clinical interest.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:35]
She pulls out a well-worn notebook, flipping it open with one hand while her other hand absently touches one of the visible tattoos on her forearm.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:35]
Half elf with wide hat:
"Captain's been here seventy-two hours straight," the woman drawls in a rough Docks accent.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:36]
Half elf with wide hat continues:
"Wouldn't leave. Had to threaten to arrest him for loitering just to get him to eat something."

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:36]
Half elf with wide hat pushes off from the doorframe and saunters closer, her boots clicking against the stone floor.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:37]
Half-elf with a wide hat :
"Detective Desdelen Bolera.
Arvensoar investigation department."

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:37]
Detective Desdelen Bolera tips her hat slightly:
"People call me Skinny.
So call me Skinny.
I'm investigating what the fuck happened at that party."

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:37]
James Darkmoon runs a hand through his unkempt hair.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:38]
James Dark-moon interrupts:
"One thousand people unconscious.
Amar Rook-moon, The Harrower, vaporised.
Selenor and Allisee are implicated in distributing the poison."

James is saying this vaguely, as if not really making a point.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:39]
Detective Desdelen "Skinny" Bolera circles closer to the beds, notebook ready, her demeanour shifting from casual to intensely professional.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:40]
Clearly, the detective is about to launch into questions.

Path Wars, [22/10/2025 01:40]
James Dark-Moon shoots her a singular glance, and she physically takes a step back.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [23/10/2025 18:21]
Akuma stands to test his balance. Once he feels comfortable with his footing, he walks over to the Captain and places his large hand gently on his shoulder. "You should rest, sir. It's time for a change in shifts."

Regardless of what James does with that statement, Akuma will look over to the detective. "What do you need from us, Skinny?"

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 20:30]
James Dark-Moon looks you directly in the eye, and you feel him looking at you on a very deep level:
"We should speak. Privately. Now."

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 20:31]
Skinny shakes her head and says to the rest of Magni Watch:
"We need you out on the street tomorrow.
Chop chop.
If you need me, I'll be up to my elven ears in paperwork."

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [24/10/2025 20:35]
"Sir."

It is all Akuma can respond with. Captain Dark-Moon is the man in charge, and if he wants to stay awake even longer to speak with him, there is nothing that can be done.

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 21:25]
Captain James Dark-Moon takes you to a semi-full storage side room, with a few boxes and with a tap on the blade of his great-sword, a rune appears.

The rune causes the walls of the room to look rubbery.

Captain James Dark-Moon:
"You have potential.
You have a clear talent for the containment and manipulation of fiend plane derived magic energy.

Talent. Not skill.

You need training.

I know about the rat on your flesh."

Captain James Dark-Moon points at wherever your rat tattoo is and moves his hand towards it:

"May I?"

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [24/10/2025 21:35]
Akuma, looking about the room, turns his right shoulder towards the captain. He yanks at the collar of his shirt to reveal the rat-like mark that sits in the supraclavicular fossa.

"Is that some sort of seal?" He asks about the rubbery look of the room.

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 21:56]
Captain James Darkmoon touches the mark with one hand and his great sword with another.

Another (different) rune appears on the great sword's surface.

The flesh seems to liquify but stays in place, bubbling on the surface.

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 21:56]
Great pain rushes through your body.

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 21:56]
BUT

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 21:56]
The green and black changes

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 21:57]
..towards fiery red and dark blue.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [24/10/2025 22:10]
Akuma's muscles tense up in response to the pain. His teeth grind audibly as a few beads of sweat form. Once the change is finished, he rolls his shoulder a few times to ensure everything is still working correctly.

"Well..." he pauses. "What was that?"

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 22:17]
Captain James Dark Moon nods slowly and then takes a few steps back.

Sweat had pooled around his hairline, a clear sign of extreme exertion:

"You have been poisoned, and you have been able to bring that together into a pool of mana.

You can let yourself be corrupted, you can let yourself be poisoned, you can let the rot remain forever.

Or.

I'll train you.

You'll learn how to *change* the form of the magic and use it.

But, if you accept, you must never tell another soul."

James Dark Moon's eyes look into yours, and you can tell he is seeing deep into you.
You can tell, if you were to tell someone, James Dark Moon would be capable of terrible things:

"Something happened in your past that touched you or a family member with dark, dark magic, and you walked away from it.

Someone probably suffered a lot to save you.

Don't let their sacrifice go in vain."

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [24/10/2025 22:54]
Akuma looks back at his rat-like mark, its new color. He is reminded of Ba-Ming and her story of the Old Rat Woman. He lets off a small chuckle as he now finds this situation ironic. The Old Rat Woman is another goddess from his homeland, a secretive one. Now he is here, being sworn to secrecy.

"I am not sure I quite understand. What am I to never tell a soul of?" He stares back into the captain's eyes as he says this, a knowing glint flickering across the sheen of his purple iris.

Path Wars, [24/10/2025 23:16]
The rat imagery has faded somewhat; eventually it'll fade altogether...if things work out that way.

Askaran Ottergryph | #1 Haku | #4 Scrit, [24/10/2025 23:24]
Machiq stands up, resting a paw on the bed while reassuring his balance. He still feels wobbly so he stays leaned against the bed.
"What is the meaning of this? Why have we survived? The MagniWatch people of all..?"
Machiq's voice is still weak and shaky.

Path Wars, [03/11/2025 15:36]
#04 Magni Watch.

Detective Desdelen "Skinny" Bolera responds to Machiq:
"Hmm.

You're asking how you survived such a curse?

Well.

The curse seemed to effect 4th rank and lower people.

Some stronger were affected.

Some weaker weren't affected at all.

It could be that the amount of tea consumed affected how strongly or weakly the tea affected individuals.

It could also be that the curse is affiliated with forms of magic that become more or less effective against people for a variety of reasons.

.....not you lot.

Far as I can see, you were all affected very badly.

You're not strong yet, definitely not 4th rank.

Captain Darkmoon says he and General Viole saved you lot.

James has some talent with magic and you've probably heard of Viole and how powerful they are.

It took a lot out of them but they saved you all.

Way I see it, you owe them both, big time."

Captain James Darkmoon has a look of relief as he responds to Akuma:
"Good.
I'll check in between missions when I'm free.
Practise in only the smallest of exertions at a time."

Captain James Darkmoon takes a sigh of relief and says:
"Any questions?"

When he asks this question you hear a slight accent creep into his voice, an accent not of Varisia.

Path Wars, [03/11/2025 15:43]
👀

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [03/11/2025 16:35]
Akuma stands there for a moment to really think of a question. He isn't finding any, and he knows there has to be a good one. This sort of topic isn't just an opinion on the weather. His mind is drawing a blank, so he decides to ask the first thing he can think of.
"So, if it isn't rude to ask, where are you from?"

Path Wars, [03/11/2025 20:06]
Captain James Darkmoon looks at you blankly and seems to have been thrown off guard by the question.

Ironic as he is a guard.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [03/11/2025 21:51]
"Your accent slip," Akuma continues, "It's not from the region." He attempts to give a reassuring smile. "It was hard to learn Varisian, though it does share a love of similar-sounding words meaning different things as my homeland's language."

Antoine / Anthony = Allisee, [14/11/2025 02:57]
Here that check is

Path Wars, [14/11/2025 18:16]
Captain James Darkmoon pauses and says:
"I don't tell people this.
I am from Andoran.
41 years ago, in 4669 AR, there was a revolt. The people's revolt.
I fought.
I killed.
I served under the legendary military commander Major Colson Maldris.
Now, I serve here."

Path Wars, [14/11/2025 18:17]
This would come as a surprise for many many reasons to Akuma.

Path Wars, [14/11/2025 18:18]
Mainly because Captain James Darkmoon looks only maybe mid to late 40s.
He already seemed "young" for having Zilde EvenGuard as a daughter; this makes it even more so.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [14/11/2025 18:30]
Akuma looks the Captain up and down for a moment, trying to see if he can update his estimate of the man's age. Failing to do so, he decides to leave the topic be for the time being, figuring the Captain would elaborate when he felt comfortable enough to do so.

"Well," he says, "It's an honor to serve under you." Giving a nod when they next meet eyes. "You should seriously get some rest. You look worse than death."

Path Wars, [14/11/2025 18:57]
Captain James Darkmoon seems relieved and smiles:
"Heh.
Very well.
It's nearly 19:00.

Get some rest, you're back to work tomorrow morning sharp."

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [14/11/2025 19:08]
Akuma salutes and leaves the room towards his bed.

Path Wars, [14/11/2025 19:27]
*Back in the infirmary.*

Path Wars, [14/11/2025 19:27]
Detective Desdelen Bolera (the half-elven detective wearing a wide-brimmed hat):
"Before you all get some rest, we have a new addition to your team to be introduced....."

Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07, [14/11/2025 19:37]
An eight inch tall figure in a dark suit and hat walks beside Detective Bolera. He flaps his wings to get up to the edge of one of the beds before flashing a toothy grin. From this vantage he introduces himself.

"Consulting Detective Báyakan, newly appointed to your service."

The fellows bat like ears twitch slightly. "Normally I wouldn't get involved in official matters. The day to day police work is a little humdrum. You lot have indeed stumbled into something interesting, though. So my eyes and ears are yours until the case is cracked. Other senses as well... But we'll get to that."

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [14/11/2025 19:53]
"Welcome to the team," Akuma responds as he plops down into the bed he was in when he awoke. The frame creaks loudly from his weight. "I'll try my best not to squish you by accident."

He looks at Báyakan directly, "but no promises." He smiles playfully at the last part.

Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07, [14/11/2025 20:28]
The nyktera continues to grin. "Not to worry. When a sprite chooses to live with tall-men, we get accustomed to our doings being felt more than seen."

Báyakan seems to listen intently for a moment. Content in familiarizing himself with any magic the team may have upon their persons, he finds a suitable place take his rest while the team recovers. Probably the top of the back of a chair.

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [14/11/2025 21:46]
From her bed, Nadya raises her head out from the pillows to get a look at the new arrival.

"A bat? The chelaxians that run this damn city are going to think we took down that zoo in order to get rid of competition."

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [14/11/2025 21:48]
Akuma snort chuckles at the words.

Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07, [14/11/2025 22:16]
Bemused, the sprite looks over at Nadya. "Not a bat, miss.  If you believe any of them witnessed what happened last night, I could ask for their statement."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [14/11/2025 22:22]
"And I'm not a fox, but try telling that to Lieutenant Lavarsus, if you haven't already."

Nadya buries her head back into the pillows with a grumble.

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [14/11/2025 22:23]
Akuma sits up seriously and looks over at Nadya. "You're not a fox?"

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [14/11/2025 22:49]
From the depths of the pillows emanates the groan of a woman whose fault it is that this topic came up. She lazily pulls herself into a sitting position off the side of the bed.

"What I am is fucking complicated. I'm a kitsune, through Daikitsu's grace we spirits look like whatever the hells we want. I choose to look like this because when I look human I am more obviously Varisian -  and really the only thing humans hate more than strange foreign foxes is other humans that look vaguely different from them. Of course there's also the part where I was born because my mother fucked a vampire, which I feel the need to stress is an awful idea. Plus, dear father is the last in a long line of wizards dating back thousands of years and somehow all that magic is mixed up in my blood too. Don't ask me how any of this fits together, because I don't have a godsdamned clue myself."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [14/11/2025 22:50]
Nadya shrugs.

"If you figure 'fox' sums that up for you, great."

Tyler Link, Hero of Time |#4 Akuma | #6 Kieran, [14/11/2025 23:16]
Akuma sheepishly replies, "I was just kidding... But I appreciate you sharing your background." He feels a bit guilty for making her feel like she had to divulge all that information.

"My mom died to give me life, that's at least what I was told. Don't know my father." He thinks back as best he can, "I honestly don't know too much about my bloodline. I only know the stares of contempt." He smiles a bit. "Ba-Ming never looked at me that way. She was the closest thing I had to a mother." He shakes himself free from his memories and lays his head back down. "Sorry to put you on the spot as a joke."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [14/11/2025 23:27]
"oh."

Nadya looks away awkwardly.

"Uh, we... We need to figure out the case so my nerves can calm down."

Chase Darkthorne | #04 Consulting Detective Báyakan |C07, [15/11/2025 00:55]
Flipping through his own notebook, Báyakan comments idly, "The right clue is unlikely to just wander in this evening. Tomorrow, perhaps. Though it seems more likely that we would wander to it."

Cannon McMahon | Illiani #5 GE | Nadya #4 MW, [17/11/2025 18:06]
Nadya flops back down onto the bed.

"We'll see what the captain has for us tomorrow, I suppose."
