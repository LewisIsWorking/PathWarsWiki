- Title: Grand Explorers (play by post).
- There is a lot of information here, but you do not need to read all or any of it. DM me, and I will walk you
  through everything.
- I like putting everything down in writing to help people get started who would benefit from having it all down in writing.
- Campaign name: Grand Explorers.
- System: Pathfinder 2e.
- Open Slots: 4.
- Time & Frequency: constant (play by post).
- Campaign Description: You are exploring the world of Golarion, seeking out the mysteries of the world.
- THIS IS NOT A WEST MARCH. I do not know why people always seem to assume this.

>> Where does the group play?
>> - The Platform the group rolls on is Foundry, you do not need to buy anything, I will help you get set up, and it is
     totally free for players.
>> - The group uses our telegram group chat for the play-by-post.

- Setting: Pathfinder's default Golarion setting.
- Level: 1. The campaign will go to level 11+.
- I recommend using Path Builder to build your character.
- You can use any PF2e content for character creation as well as the StarFinder 2e playtest content.
- What can I play regarding race, class, background, etc? Well, you can play anything.
- You do not need to make your character a dual class.
- The vetting process is on our discord server, **it is NOT in my DMs with you**.

New players are welcome to DM me to join.
