# The Duergar of PW-Golarion

The duergar, known as grey dwarves, are among the most ruthless and technologically advanced denizens of Golarion's Darklands. 

These ash-skinned descendants of surface dwarves have evolved into something far more sinister in the depths below.

## Physical Characteristics & Culture

Duergar possesses pale grey to charcoal skin, stark white or silver hair, and cold, calculating eyes that reflect their harsh underground existence. 

Both sexes are typically bald or keep their hair severely cropped, adorning themselves with intricate piercings and brands that denote rank, achievement or ownership status within their rigid caste system.

Their society operates on principles of absolute dominance and technological superiority. 

Duergar cities are marvels of dark engineering: towering spires of black iron and enchanted stone, powered by enslaved elementals and fed by the suffering of countless thralls. 

Steam-powered machinery and clockwork automatons serve alongside broken-willed slaves in their foundries and workshops.

## Abilities & Technology

Beyond their natural dwarven resilience, duergar possess inherent psionic abilities allowing them to enlarge themselves to giant proportions or turn invisible at will. 

Their most feared warriors can grow to twice normal size mid-combat, wielding massive weapons with devastating effect.

Their technological prowess manifests in sophisticated clockwork constructs, alchemical weapons that emit choking gases, and elaborate torture devices that serve both practical and recreational purposes. 

Duergar artificers craft items that blend arcane magic with mechanical precision: 
crossbows that fire multiple bolts simultaneously, armour that enhances their psionic abilities, and vehicles that traverse the treacherous Darklands terrain.

## Role in Darklands Society

The duergar control vast slave-trading networks throughout the Darklands, dealing in surface dwellers, other Darklands races, and even demons when profitable. 

Their fortress-cities serve as hubs of commerce and cruelty, where flesh markets operate alongside weapon forges and alchemical laboratories.

They maintain an uneasy but profitable relationship with other Darklands powers, trading their superior craftsmanship and military expertise for resources and territorial concessions. 

Their disciplined armies and advanced siege engines make them formidable opponents that even the dark-elves treat with cautious respect.

## Religion.

> Just like in standard lore, duergar primarily worship Droskar, the Dark Smith, the god of toil, slavery and oppression. 
>> - There are some mythical but non-god-tier Mythic beings that live amongst the duergar.

> Ferrum Mortis. 
>> - The Iron Tyrant.
>> - A clockwork Mythic of technological domination, whose priests maintain the great slave-powered engines and construct increasingly complex automatons. 
>> - Worship involves ritualistic branding and the offering of perfectly crafted mechanical components.

> The Gear Mother. 
>> - A twisted fertility Mythic who demands the breeding of optimal slave stock and the "perfection" of bloodlines through selective breeding and mechanical augmentation. 
>> - Her temples double as breeding pens and body modification workshops.

> Umbral Artifex.
>> - Mythic of dark innovation. 
>> - Worshipped by duergar engineers who push the boundaries of magic-tech fusion. 
>> - Followers often replace parts of their bodies with clockwork prosthetics as acts of devotion.

## The lack of beards on Female Duergar.

Female duergars do not have full beards. This is to create a visual distinction and fits the "evolved beyond their surface cousins" theme. 

> Instead, they might have:
>> - Carefully maintained goatees or chin braids as status symbols.
>> - Intricate facial piercings where surface dwarf women would have beard jewellery.
>> - Ritual scarification on their jawlines.
>> - Some might shave entirely as a mark of their rejection of surface dwarf traditions.

## Dwarf beards.

> Nearly all surface dwarves have full beards, often elaborately braided and decorated.
>> - Makes the duergar's clean-shaven/minimal facial hair a stark cultural rejection of their heritage.
>> - Female dwarves can have beards but often prefer goatees, sideburns or chin tufts.
