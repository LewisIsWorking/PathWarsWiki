# Campaign~Path-wars-timeline.

> The timeline.
>> - Anything that happens across any campaign run by the Path Wars collective is canon across all the campaigns.
>> - This means in practice that an event that happens in Crimson Throne (4708 AR) has canonically happened in the 
past of campaigns set in the future such as Doomsday Funtime (4709 AR → 4710 AR onwards).

## Table of Contents.

>> Below is a timeline that shows what campaign happens when chronologically. 
> The chronological aspect of the campaign is important 
when determining if specific events have happened and for the purpose of unlocked items.
