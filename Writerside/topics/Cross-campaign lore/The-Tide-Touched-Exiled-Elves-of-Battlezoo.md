> The Tide-Touched Exiles
>> - The few elves found in the Indigo Isles are not native to these cursed waters.
>> - They are the Maelstrom-Sworn, descendants of an ancient elven armada that was pulled into the dimensional vortex surrounding the isles centuries ago during a failed attempt to conquer them.
>> - The arcane storms that rage between dimensions have fundamentally altered these elves over generations.
>> - Physical Transformation: 
>> - Their skin bears intricate, shifting tattoo-like patterns that pulse with bioluminescent indigo light, marking the ebb and flow of the tides in their very flesh. 
>> - Their eyes have become deep violet, almost black, capable of seeing through the supernatural mists that shroud the isles.
>> - Many have developed gills along their necks, and their fingers are webbed with translucent membranes.
>> - Arcane Integration: These elves have learned to bind sea creatures and elemental forces directly into their bodies through forbidden blood magic.
>> - Many sport symbiotic organisms: sentient coral growths that enhance their spellcasting, or parasitic sea anemones that filter toxins and provide magical sight. 
>> - Their arcane technology involves living ships grown from massive sea creatures, weapons forged from crystallised kraken blood, and armour made from the scales of deep-sea leviathans.
>> - Cultural Darkness: 
>> - Centuries of isolation and dimensional exposure have created a society built on ritualistic sacrifice to the tide gods. 
>> - They practice soul-binding with sea creatures, permanently merging their consciousness with aquatic beasts to gain their abilities. 
>> - Their reproduction involves complex rituals in underwater grottoes where partners must survive being partially devoured by summoned horrors to prove their genetic worth.
