## Overview

The party has returned to Kibwe to find the city transformed by the slithering curse. 

They must navigate the chaos to reach the Temple of the Sun, where Paga Nikohian and the Aspis Consortium have fortified themselves.

---

## The State of Kibwe

When the party entered the city:
- Guard towers unmanned—massive slimes have fused with the defensive walls.
- Small hamlets, stables and markets outside the walls lay destroyed or deserted.
- Streets nearly empty; only non-human corpses litter the way.
- No humans visible (all transformed or hiding).
- Shops shuttered, market stalls abandoned.
- Burning buildings crackle throughout the city.
- Distant screams cut off with wet, bubbling gurgles.

> **Tal'lysae's Assessment:**
>> - "You have been gone for days, but.... I have a feeling a certain halfling has accelerated the curse. If I had to take a guess... Paga Nikohian is in the Sun Temple right now."

## Encounters En Route to the Sun Temple

### 1: The Dinosaur and the merchant slime *(IN PROGRESS)*

**Location:** Wide merchant street

**What Happened:**
1. A sick, slime-dripping human merchant was beating his triceratops
2. On the third strike, the merchant transformed into a **sewer ooze**
3. The triceratops screamed and snapped its harness
4. A Pharasmin dwarf attempted to calm the beast
5. The dwarf was **impaled** on the triceratops's horn
6. The merchant slime grabbed the dwarf and absorbed his **divine spirit**
7. The slime evolved into a **White Flame Merchant Slime**
8. The dwarf's corpse is now embedded in the slime's core like a battery.

**Current Situation:**
- Kieran is attempting to calm the triceratops (Nature check: 25)
- The triceratops is terrified of the evolved slime (DC significantly reduced)
- Lorn senses kinship with the White Flame Slime—like a "cousin once removed" through Selenor.
- Tal'lysae is disturbed: "That's not how this was supposed to go...."

**Unresolved Questions:**
- What is the White Flame Slime? Why does Lorn sense familial connection?
- Will the party fight it, befriend it, or flee?
- What happened to the triceratops?

## Cursebreaker's Status

**Eda Stone-Worth** sprinted ahead of the party with extreme speed after turning the service tunnel door to ash:
> "The temple is calling me. I must go swiftly."

She is likely already at or inside the Temple of the Sun. 

The party cannot catch up to her through normal means.
