## The State of Kibwe

When the party entered the city, they found:
- Guard towers unmanned—massive slimes had fused with the defensive walls.
- Small hamlets, stables and markets outside the walls destroyed or deserted.
- Streets nearly empty; only non-human corpses visible.
- Shops shuttered, market stalls abandoned.
- Burning buildings throughout the city.
- Distant screams cut off with wet, bubbling gurgles.

**Tal'lysae mentioned:** A halfling named **Paga Nikohian** may have accelerated the curse and is likely in the Sun Temple.

## Current Encounter: The Irate Dinosaur

**Location:** Wide merchant street

**What Happened:**
1. A sick merchant was beating his triceratops, demanding it move
2. On the third strike, the merchant transformed into a sewer ooze
3. The triceratops screamed and snapped its harness
4. A Pharasmin dwarf attempted to calm the beast but was impaled
5. The merchant slime grabbed the dying dwarf
6. The dwarf's divine spirit was absorbed—the slime evolved into a **White Flame Slime**
7. The dwarf's corpse is now embedded in the slime's core

**Current Situation:**
- Kieran is protecting the terrified triceratops (Nature check: 25)
- Lorn sensed kinship with the White Flame Slime
- Tal'lysae is disturbed by this development
- Combat with the White Flame Slime appears imminent
