## Play By Post - Session 2 (2025 September 14th)

**Location:** Holy Xatramba - Inner Sanctum

### The Rebirth of Curse Breaker

Leilani Kana led a ritual to restore Eda "Curse Breaker" Stone-Worth to physical form.

As Tarsus and Kieran wove their threads of the ritual into completion, the primal harmonies converged upon Leilani with inexorable purpose. She stood at the nexus of forces both divine and primordial, her very essence becoming the conduit for something far greater than mere spellcraft. This was blood calling to blood, soul recognising soul across the veil of mortality itself.

The phoenix fire that had once consumed her death now blazed anew within her veins—not as borrowed power, but as inheritance rightfully claimed.

Crimson light spilled from her outstretched palms, each droplet of mystical essence carrying fragments of Eda's scattered form back toward its destined vessel. As radiance flooded the chamber with golden intensity, something primal stirred within her throat. The song that emerged was older than words, a melody that seemed to rise from the very marrow of creation.

When silence finally reclaimed the chamber, it carried within it the weight of completed destiny. The debt had been paid. The shepherd had become the saviour of her own salvation.

### Curse Breaker Awakens

Eda "Curse Breaker" Stone-Worth's body—previously burned to ash in the fire of the phoenix—reformed in blinding golden light. As the light gently faded, a figure stood where Curse Breaker once rested.

**Eda Stone-Worth The Curse Breaker:**
> "I must return to the temple of the sun. Those who must be purged are there. And I must connect myself to the city once more."

Without hesitation, Eda turned and walked *through* a wall, shattering it and leaving a massive Eda-shaped gap. In the courtyard, she looked up at the sun, closed her eyes, face tilted upward, and with a sudden clap of her hands, opened a portal.

Through the portal, the party glimpsed the impossibly tall walls of Kibwe—a portal home! But standing on the other side was a female red slime woman who had just appeared in front of Eda.

**Daichi Kenshin** grabbed Theron and threw him through the portal before stepping in himself:
> "Well, at least the return trip will be less tedious. Come on people, do not just stand around! Let us follow the curse breaker."

## Play By Post - Session 3 (2025 October - December)

**Location:** Kibwe - Outside the City Walls

### The Red Slime Woman

The party emerged from the portal to find Eda confronting a strange red slime woman—Tal'lysae.

### Kieran's Communion

As Kieran observed Eda (now in slime form after the ritual), he felt an ancient presence speak directly into his mind—**Pidge**, the demon lord he had freed from the sealed book.

Pidge revealed biblical lore that mortals were never meant to hear:

> "Time has existed for longer than you can imagine. Time has gone through cycles of birth and rebirth. Few survive. I am one of those few."

Pidge spoke of an entity far older than himself, one who had "bathed in the blood of a billion, billion worlds" and committed horrors beyond description—then written it all down in a book. 

This being's grandson (Selenor) created Lorn.

Pidge urged the party to accept alliance with this entity's servants or face a far worse fate in ten years' time.

### Tal'lysae Speaks

Tal'lysae revealed her nature to the party—her divine spirit had died, and at that moment of death, she was saved and chosen to become an angel of the Red Flame.

**Lorn** (recognising something familiar):
> "You served one of the flames, didn't you?! By saying your divine spirit being dead you mean... that you are not of this cycle, are you?"

### The Alliance Terms

**Tal'lysae:**
> "The flame shall protect the city, and the flame shall be seeded within its walls. The flame knows how to reawaken the wall's magical wards; the city will be safe, with our protection."

**Kieran:**
> "Yes, but what is expected of the city and of us?"

**Tal'lysae:**
> "Work with the flame, save the world. I will also accept simply helping to defend the city but... you are all so much more capable of... *MORE*."

**Lorn** extended his hand to Tal'lysae:
> "I think we can do more too, but as family, Tal'lysae. Based on my father's memory your master is my relative and you too in some way I think. You have my bow in the coming war. Let's save what we love and regain what we have lost."

**Tarsus Longstaff:**
> "If something else is going to come along in ten years, I'd rather not be dealing with the curse at the same time. May as well deal with what's in front of us so that we're ready for whatever comes next."

**Fierce Leopard Cyrus:**
> "I agree. We can't be splitting our focus or something will slip through the cracks. Let's deal with the curse. We might luck out and get some clues that help with our other problems."

**Kieran** (nodding slowly, then with growing confidence):
> "Right. Let's do this."

### The Disturbance

**Tal'lysae** suddenly gurgled, her form shivering:
> "That. I felt it. A disturbance in the air, a movement in the earth. This must end."

**Leilani Kana:**
> "Speak plainly. Tal'lysae, what did you feel? What is it?"

**Tal'lysae's** form shuddered, rippling like disturbed water:
> "The flow... stutters. Time itself hiccups. Something far beyond this city. Far beyond this world. It reaches into the threads of reality and pulls."
> 
> "You do not feel it but time is not flowing as it should. I cannot see it clearly. The Flame shields me from such... enormities."
> 
> "But what I can see is that your city dies while we speak. The curse spreads. Your people transform. And the Archive of the Sun... Where Eda, The Curse Breaker, must reach, and soon. It is held by those who care nothing for Kibwe's survival but their own shallow desires."
> 
> "We go. Now. The Flame will guide us, but the path will not be gentle. .... The city is sliming."

## Play By Post - Session 4 (2025 December - 2026 January)

**Location:** Kibwe - Inside the City

### Tiny Departs

As the party prepared to enter the city, Tiny announced his departure:
> "Honestly this isn't what I was hired for, I'm sure you guys can handle it without me."

**Tal'lysae** watched him leave:
> "Dark forces cloud his soul, it is better he leaves now. You do not want an ally to... stab you in the back...."

### Entering Kibwe

Kieran took point, his bow glowing softly as he led the party toward the city gates. The guard towers were unmanned—instead, massive slimes had filled them, fusing with the defensive walls themselves.

Tal'lysae guided the party around the walls for over 30 minutes, passing destroyed hamlets, abandoned stables, and deserted markets. She led them to a service trapdoor and down through tunnels where even tiny slime organisms crawled along the ground.

At a magically-locked stone door, **Eda Stone-Worth** simply clicked her fingers and turned it to ash:
> "The temple is calling me. I must go swiftly."

Eda **leapt** forward with extreme speed, disappearing hundreds of metres ahead in seconds. The party could not hope to keep pace.

### The City Transformed

Emerging into the light, the party witnessed disaster. The streets were nearly empty—only non-human corpses littered the way. No humans in sight. Shops shuttered. Market stalls abandoned. A child's doll half-dissolved in the gutter. Distant screams cut off with wet, bubbling gurgles. Burning buildings crackled throughout the city.

**Fierce Leopard Cyrus:**
> "This is worse than I could have imagined. How could it have progressed so quickly?"

**Tal'lysae:**
> "You have been gone for days, but.... I have a feeling a certain halfling has accelerated the curse. If I had to take a guess... Paga Nikohian is in the Sun Temple right now."

### The Irate Dinosaur

Moving through a wide merchant street, the party witnessed a sick, slime-dripping human merchant frantically beating his triceratops:
> "Move, you stubborn bitch! MOVE!"

On the third strike, his arm dissolved. The transformation was horrifyingly fast—his body collapsed into a stinking sewage-brown slime. The triceratops screamed in terror, snapping its harness as the slime splashed across its legs.

### The Pharasmin Dwarf

A Pharasmin dwarf in midnight blue robes appeared, attempting to calm the beast with whispered words. But his impatient leap toward the dinosaur ended in disaster—the triceratops lowered its horn defensively, and the dwarf was **impaled**.

The merchant slime immediately grabbed the struggling dwarf with a sloppy appendage. As contact was made, the dwarf **exploded in a ball of white light**.

**Tal'lysae:**
> "His divine spirit! No. No. No. No. No. That's not supposed to happen. The odds of... The flame shouldn't..."

### The White Flame Slime

Where three entities once stood, now only the terrified triceratops and a transformed slime remained. The merchant slime had **evolved**—bigger, stronger, glowing with white light. The dwarf's corpse was embedded in its core like a battery.

**Tal'lysae:**
> "That's not how this was supposed to go...."

**Lorn** sensed familiar energies. A kinship with this slime. He sensed his father, Selenor. As if this slime was his... cousin once removed.

The triceratops, now terrified of the evolved slime, became significantly easier to calm.

**Kieran** positioned himself between the beast and the White Flame Slime, hoping the dinosaur would understand he was trying to protect it.
