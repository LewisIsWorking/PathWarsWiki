# Campaign #6: Kibwe

**Campaign Start:** 22nd & 23rd April 2023  
**Format:** In-person sessions + Play-by-Post

---

## Campaign Overview

The city of Kibwe faces an existential threat. A magical cursed disease is transforming every human within its walls into slime—and time is running out. The party must retrieve a sacred artifact from the demon-haunted ruins of Holy Xatramba to save the city before it's too late.

---

## The Story So Far

### The Curse

A terrible magical plague has begun spreading through Kibwe. Humans exposed to the curse undergo a horrifying transformation, their bodies slowly converting to ooze. Without intervention, the entire human population will be lost.

### The Curse Breaker

The statue known as **Curse Breaker** (a sacred ram) was once one of the animal statues mounted upon Kibwe's walls. For generations, it protected the city from evil spirits and curses. The sun priests revered it as a sacred relic, and caster classes have long drawn spell slots from its power.

The statue was moved from the walls to the **Temple of the Sun Archive** for safekeeping—but it has been stolen and taken to Holy Xatramba.

### Holy Xatramba

The ruins of Holy Xatramba lie in the eastern jungle of the Mwangi Expanse, southwest of Kibwe. Once a magnificent holy city, it was destroyed by demons summoned during an ancient trade war and has been haunted ever since.

The party journeyed to Xatramba, fought through demon-infested ruins, and successfully retrieved Curse Breaker. Through an elaborate ritual led by Leilani Kana, Eda Stone-Worth was reborn as the living avatar of Curse Breaker herself.

### Return to Kibwe

Eda opened a portal directly to Kibwe, and the party followed her through—only to encounter a mysterious red slime woman named **Tal'lysae**, who claims to serve the "Red Flame" and offers an alliance to save the city.
