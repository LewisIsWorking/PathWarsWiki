## Overview

The Temple of the Sun is an ancient building in the southern end of the Mozimba Camp neighbourhood of Kibwe. 

The party must reach it so that **Eda Stone-Worth The Curse-Breaker** can complete her ritual.

According to Tal'lysae, the Temple is currently held by people "who care nothing for Kibwe's survival but their own shallow desires." 

She specifically mentioned **Paga Nikohian** as being in the Sun Temple.

- The Temple contains ancient magic connected to the Pillar-Watchers.
- Curse-breaker must reach the Temple to address the slithering curse.
