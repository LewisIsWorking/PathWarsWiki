## Overview

The Temple of the Sun is an ancient building in the southern end of the Mozimba Camp neighbourhood of Kibwe. 

Once a laboratory or library where the Pillar-Watchers were empowered during the age of legends.

The party must clear the Temple so that **Eda Stone-Worth The Curse-Breaker** can reach the Chamber of the Upper Sun and complete her ritual to address the slithering curse.

## Session Log

*To be updated as the party progresses through the Temple.*

### Not Yet Reached

The party is still en route to the Temple, dealing with the Irate Dinosaur and White Flame Slime encounter.
