## Play By Post - Session 2 (2025 September 14th)

**Location:** Holy Xatramba - Inner Sanctum

### The Rebirth of Curse Breaker

Leilani Kana led a ritual to restore Eda "Curse Breaker" Stone-Worth to physical form.

As Tarsus and Kieran wove their threads of the ritual into completion, the primal harmonies converged upon Leilani with inexorable purpose. She stood at the nexus of forces both divine and primordial, her very essence becoming the conduit for something far greater than mere spellcraft. This was blood calling to blood, soul recognising soul across the veil of mortality itself.

The phoenix fire that had once consumed her death now blazed anew within her veins—not as borrowed power, but as inheritance rightfully claimed.

Crimson light spilled from her outstretched palms, each droplet of mystical essence carrying fragments of Eda's scattered form back toward its destined vessel. As radiance flooded the chamber with golden intensity, something primal stirred within her throat. The song that emerged was older than words, a melody that seemed to rise from the very marrow of creation.

When silence finally reclaimed the chamber, it carried within it the weight of completed destiny. The debt had been paid. The shepherd had become the saviour of her own salvation.

### Curse Breaker Awakens

Eda "Curse Breaker" Stone-Worth's body—previously burned to ash in the fire of the phoenix—reformed in blinding golden light. As the light gently faded, a figure stood where Curse Breaker once rested.

**Eda Stone-Worth The Curse Breaker:**
> "I must return to the temple of the sun. Those who must be purged are there. And I must connect myself to the city once more."

Without hesitation, Eda turned and walked *through* a wall, shattering it and leaving a massive Eda-shaped gap. In the courtyard, she looked up at the sun, closed her eyes, face tilted upward, and with a sudden clap of her hands, opened a portal.

Through the portal, the party glimpsed the impossibly tall walls of Kibwe—a portal home! But standing on the other side was a female red slime woman who had just appeared in front of Eda.

**Daichi Kenshin** grabbed Theron and threw him through the portal before stepping in himself:
> "Well, at least the return trip will be less tedious. Come on people, do not just stand around! Let us follow the curse breaker."

## Play By Post - Session 3 (2025 October - December)

**Location:** Kibwe - Outside the City Walls

### The Red Slime Woman

The party emerged from the portal to find Eda confronting a strange red slime woman—Tal'lysae.

### Kieran's Communion

As Kieran observed Eda (now in slime form after the ritual), he felt an ancient presence speak directly into his mind—**Pidge**, the demon lord bound to his grandfather's soul.

Pidge revealed biblical lore that mortals were never meant to hear:

> "Time has existed for longer than you can imagine. Time has gone through cycles of birth and rebirth. Few survive. I am one of those few."

Pidge spoke of an entity far older than himself, one who had "bathed in the blood of a billion, billion worlds" and committed horrors beyond description—then written it all down in a book. This being's great-grandson created Lorn.

Pidge urged the party to accept alliance with this entity's servants or face a far worse fate in ten years' time.

### Tal'lysae Speaks

Tal'lysae revealed her nature to the party—her divine spirit had died, and in that moment of death, she was saved and chosen to become an angel of the Red Flame.

**Lorn** (recognising something familiar):
> "You served one of the flames, didn't you?! By saying your divine spirit being dead you mean... that you are not of this cycle, are you?"

### The Alliance Terms

**Tal'lysae:**
> "The flame shall protect the city, and the flame shall be seeded within its walls. The flame knows how to reawaken the wall's magical wards; the city will be safe, with our protection."

**Kieran:**
> "Yes, but what is expected of the city and of us?"

**Tal'lysae:**
> "Work with the flame, save the world. I will also accept simply helping to defend the city but... you are all so much more capable of... *MORE*."

**Lorn** extended his hand to Tal'lysae:
> "I think we can do more too, but as family, Tal'lysae. Based on my father's memory your master is my relative and you too in some way I think. You have my bow in the coming war. Let's save what we love and regain what we have lost."

**Tarsus Longstaff:**
> "If something else is going to come along in ten years, I'd rather not be dealing with the curse at the same time. May as well deal with what's in front of us so that we're ready for whatever comes next."

**Fierce Leopard Cyrus:**
> "I agree. We can't be splitting our focus or something will slip through the cracks. Let's deal with the curse. We might luck out and get some clues that help with our other problems."

**Kieran** (nodding slowly, then with growing confidence):
> "Right. Let's do this."

### The Disturbance

**Tal'lysae** suddenly gurgled, her form shivering:
> "That. I felt it. A disturbance in the air, a movement in the earth. This must end."

**Leilani Kana:**
> "Speak plainly. Tal'lysae, what did you feel? What is it?"

## Current Status
