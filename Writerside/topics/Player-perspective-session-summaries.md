## Rune wheel.

> By Ross.

So they ended the seagull island arc, and as a result found this weird thing.

After Tammerhawk and a few other great arcane minds spent time researching it,
they found out they can use the rune wheel as a sort of window into the past. 

We would be experiencing it sort of like actors without a script,
being where we are supposed to be without knowing exactly what our role is.

Tammerhawk ended up spending an entire fortune and like,
every even mildly magical man (I mean seriously, she included carnon in the ritual) to activate it.
Then asked us to view the past and help her sort out her memories.


## Session 230. 2024 December 29th Sunday + 4710 AR, 28th Arodus. + Osiria ritual part 2.

> By Ross.

Osiria Arc pt 1.
Home of the [[Jewelled Sages]]. 

There is dead spawn of Rovagug. 

The Beetle was slain by many mages. 

The shell of this beetle has a city around it.

Feathered Turban.

We are searching for the Scarab jewels? Each is priceless and a powerful magical artifact with the ability to unlock the ancient knowledge and magic of Ancient Osiria. Amemphious believes that the lack of these jewels him impotent. The diamond sage has these jewels? In the something desert. The diamond sage is necessary to conduct the Ritual of the Jewels. Amephious has other leads. This city is strange, and has magical protections that will raise alarms should we teleport into this city. Ancient stone walls surround Etho, they are magically warded, hundreds of metres tall and are impossible to climb. Go into the city, meet with the information broker. Find the Diamond Sage. House of the White Urius. Not near the slums. Rich part of the city.

Carnon gets the contact information of a City Guide. 
There is pregnant griffin around? 
Mahoo the Gate Keeper Customs Agent is a challenging boss,
but through MANY meandering checks we eventually ended up crafting a fake geode, and gave it to them to hold it.

Etho Bazaar is where merchants would not try to scam non-locals.
He goes through us one by one.
Selenor is undead and necromancer scum, but necromancer scum is allowed!
The ultimate authority on Pharasma is in the capital city of Osiria.
Inebni Andabar.

Nercomancer scum might be interested in The Grand Library ran by Khamos Al-Awlaq.

The most powerful follower of Lemashtu lives in the hills. 
8th rank spell caster.

MAHOO TAKES CARNONS HERBS AND SPICES.
Mahoo gives the party a Merchants Docket.

We do not get XP for defeating this boss.
:( 

House of the White Cobra.
Viole harasses a pompous local who is able to point us in the right direction.
Carnon is sent to the Osirian Blacksite, because they would not remove their skin.
Liar joins them.
The main group is given alcohol,
Selenor gives Cardigan alcohol then remembers
that Cardigan goes into a murderous and lustful rage if she drinks alcohol.
Allisee gives Cardigan hot tub water instead of Alcohol, it tastes like toe cheese.

Torch of the Shadow Government gives us tasks. When completed, we will learn about the Diamond Sage.
- Slip a book into Professor Lozar's Belongings. School of Sciences.
- Get artefacts from the wall? Find stash within the wall. Deliver to Torch.
- Madam Zelekhati. Seduce her secrets out of her?
- Secret from the hundred-finger Gang. Viole has passcode/passphrase?

Viole murders a man, just for fun?? They can resurrect him to find the criminal. 
We go investigate the wall that The Shadow Governlent told us about. Find a bunch of wells. 
There are snakes in the well. Main big well has black rancid water.
 Water reacts strange to Allisee, clumps up? heats up and evaporates when Lire and Viole touches it. Divine magic, as old as lissala. 
Allisee descends into the water, very slowly swimming down until she reaches a room.
 There is a diamond shaped hot tub. Some checks reveal a lever, and a man who is definitely not Nethys. 
Allisee gets into combat with two massive snakes. After 1 minutes, Viole jumps in after Allisee, quite heroically. Carnon follows, and falls on a snake killing it. 

Vision with Sarenrae? 
Snakes are eating Sarenrae. 
Snake vision eating Viole, crushing their bones in a temple in a 
jungle. 
Bird person invokes great magical powers, eye of Abaddon in the background. 
Selenor might have woken up some old gods along with the horsemen. 
Burial mask carved from Lapis Lazuli. Treasure worth 500g. 
3 clay tablets describing funeral practises.
Rod carved of old dried wood, shaped like a viper. 
Scroll of false life
gentle Repose.
Speak with the dead.

Acquired the rod for Shadow Government

> Sherfield / Lire:
>> - Lire scribes this tale and hands a copy to Obo.
>> - The Candle Soul Legacy
>> - In the golden sands of Osirion, where ancient secrets whisper to the winds, there lived a merchant of renown, Obo of the Candle Soul. 
>> - His name echoed in the bazaars, a beacon of both wealth and wisdom. 
>> - But beneath the shimmering veneer of success lay a tale etched in vengeance and sorrow.
>> - Obo's mother, Mobo, was the true architect of their family’s legacy. 
>> - Known as the "Twilight Wanderer", 
>> - she wove tales of gods and stars into her trade, her devout worship of Sarenrae granting her both fortune and fervor. 
>> - Yet it was not the desert sun that claimed her life, but an entity of unfathomable power—the Living Prismatic Sphere, 
a living demigod born of ancient magics and unbridled wrath.
>> - Years passed, and the grief hardened into resolve within Obo. 
>> - His family’s connection to Sarenrae was deeper than most understood. 
>> - They bore a spiritual truth known as the Candle Soul—a fragment of divine light that had illuminated their lineage for centuries.
>> - Obo swore to avenge his mother and unravel the mysteries of the Sphere. He knew he could not confront such an entity alone. From the depths of the Inner Sea to the towering spires of Absalom, he sought heroes with the courage to defy a living god. He offered them riches and relics, though his true gift was the promise of purpose: to confront an entity that mocked the divine order itself.
