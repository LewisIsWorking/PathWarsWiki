## Rune wheel.

> By Ross.

So they ended the seagull island arc, and as a result found this weird thing.

After Tammerhawk and a few other great arcane minds spent time researching it,
they found out they can use the rune wheel as a sort of window into the past. 

We would be experiencing it sort of like actors without a script,
being where we are supposed to be without knowing exactly what our role is.

Tammerhawk ended up spending an entire fortune and like,
every even mildly magical man (I mean seriously, she included carnon in the ritual) to activate it.
Then asked us to view the past and help her sort out her memories.

> By Ross.

Osiria Arc pt 1.
Home of the [[Jewelled Sages]]. 

There is dead spawn of Rovagug. 

The Beetle was slain by many mages. 

The shell of this beetle has a city around it.

Feathered Turban.

We are searching for the Scarab jewels? Each is priceless and a powerful magical artifact with the ability to unlock the ancient knowledge and magic of Ancient Osiria. Amemphious believes that the lack of these jewels him impotent. The diamond sage has these jewels? In the something desert. The diamond sage is necessary to conduct the Ritual of the Jewels. Amephious has other leads. This city is strange, and has magical protections that will raise alarms should we teleport into this city. Ancient stone walls surround Etho, they are magically warded, hundreds of metres tall and are impossible to climb. Go into the city, meet with the information broker. Find the Diamond Sage. House of the White Urius. Not near the slums. Rich part of the city.

Carnon gets the contact information of a City Guide. 
There is pregnant griffin around? 
Mahoo the Gate Keeper Customs Agent is a challenging boss,
but through MANY meandering checks we eventually ended up crafting a fake geode, and gave it to them to hold it.

Etho Bazaar is where merchants would not try to scam non-locals.
He goes through us one by one.
Selenor is undead and necromancer scum, but necromancer scum is allowed!
The ultimate authority on Pharasma is in the capital city of Osiria.
Inebni Andabar.

Nercomancer scum might be interested in The Grand Library ran by Khamos Al-Awlaq.

The most powerful follower of Lemashtu lives in the hills. 
8th rank spell caster.

MAHOO TAKES CARNONS HERBS AND SPICES.
Mahoo gives the party a Merchants Docket.

We do not get XP for defeating this boss.
:( 

House of the White Cobra.
Viole harasses a pompous local who is able to point us in the right direction.
Carnon is sent to the Osirian Blacksite, because they would not remove their skin.
Liar joins them.
The main group is given alcohol,
Selenor gives Cardigan alcohol then remembers
that Cardigan goes into a murderous and lustful rage if she drinks alcohol.
Allisee gives Cardigan hot tub water instead of Alcohol, it tastes like toe cheese.

Torch of the Shadow Government gives us tasks. When completed, we will learn about the Diamond Sage.
- Slip a book into Professor Lozar's Belongings. School of Sciences.
- Get artefacts from the wall? Find stash within the wall. Deliver to Torch.
- Madam Zelekhati. Seduce her secrets out of her?
- Secret from the hundred-finger Gang. Viole has passcode/passphrase?

Viole murders a man, just for fun?? They can resurrect him to find the criminal. 
We go investigate the wall that The Shadow Governlent told us about. Find a bunch of wells. 
There are snakes in the well. Main big well has black rancid water.
 Water reacts strange to Allisee, clumps up? heats up and evaporates when Lire and Viole touches it. Divine magic, as old as lissala. 
Allisee descends into the water, very slowly swimming down until she reaches a room.
 There is a diamond shaped hot tub. Some checks reveal a lever, and a man who is definitely not Nethys. 
Allisee gets into combat with two massive snakes. After 1 minutes, Viole jumps in after Allisee, quite heroically. Carnon follows, and falls on a snake killing it. 

Vision with Sarenrae? 
Snakes are eating Sarenrae. 
Snake vision eating Viole, crushing their bones in a temple in a 
jungle. 
Bird person invokes great magical powers, eye of Abaddon in the background.

Session 231 Summary
Setting:
Time: 2025 January 5th IRL / 4710 AR, 29th Arodus (Golarion date).
Context: Third part of the Osiria Ritual arc.
Key Developments and Events:
Preparation for Madamne Zelekhati Encounter:
Cardigan acquires a map of Osiria.
Selenor struggles with using maps effectively.
Viole's Directive: The group is advised not to escalate or draw blood during the encounter with Madamne Zelekhati, who is revealed to be an elven supremacist.
The Bazaar and its Mysteries:
The group explores the Eto Bazaar, a chaotic market known for its rejection of Absalom Trade Standards and its mix of financial statuses.
Haggling dominates the bazaar as the group seeks a gift for Madamne Zelekhati.
Obo the Candle Merchant:
The group meets Obo, a goblin merchant selling magical, colorful candles and rare magical dust.
Obo's Backstory:
His family’s lineage is tied to the Living Prismatic Spear, an ancient entity described as an eternal guardian of light and flame, born from chaos in the deep ground.
His mother, Mobo, was known as the "Twilight Wanderer" and a devout worshiper of Sarenrae. She was killed by the Living Prismatic Spear, leaving Obo with a legacy of grief and vengeance.
Magical Offerings:
Obo offers Envy Dust, a rare substance found in ruins of the Ancient Osirian and Sin Empire, for 9 gold pieces.
The dust is said to enhance or dispel abjuration magic.
Condition: The party must swear to confront the Living Prismatic Spear to gain Obo's full support.
Archon Star Mace:
A family heirloom obtained generations ago from the vault of the Living Prismatic Spear.
Obo offers the mace to the party, describing it as linked to a “tear in the veil” between worlds.
Carnon’s Experience: While holding the mace, Carnon has a vivid vision of being crushed by a golem in a starry expanse.
Gold Rush and Hidden Riches:
The discussion reveals that much of Osiria lies buried beneath hundreds of feet of sand, hiding untold artifacts and treasures.
If fully unearthed, Osiria could become a world superpower.
Lire’s Contribution:
Lire records Obo's tale in a written work titled "The Candle Soul Legacy" and gifts it to Obo.

The Candle Soul Legacy
Written by Lire, this tale captures Obo’s history and motivations:
Mobo, the Twilight Wanderer: Obo’s mother, a devout follower of Sarenrae, wove divine tales into her trade.
The Living Prismatic Spear: A demigod born of chaos and ancient magics, responsible for Mobo's death.
Obo's Resolve: Driven by vengeance, Obo seeks heroes to challenge the entity that claimed his mother and threatens the divine order.
