## The Ending of Crimson Throne.

## The Final Party.

1. John Vulso.
2. Ophelia Vulso.
3. Ivar. The Cursed Blackjack.
4. Philip The Third.
5. Trinia.
6. Zillith.
7. Drow.

## The Battle of the Ever-Dawn Pool.

John Vulso fought the Queen single-handedly as Trinia and Ophelia got the rest of the party to their feet.

Trinia even resuscitated Ivar, who had momentarily passed on.

Ophelia mounted Ivar and landed the final blow.

The Crown of Fangs was separated from Queen Ilosa Arabasti from the power of the holy sword Serethial.

Queen Ilosa Arabasti was turned into a Vampire Queen and hurled to the bottom of the Ever-Dawn Pool, the resting place of the Runelord of Lust Sorshen.

Ivar The Blackjack (thanks to the effect of a Harrow Card) then donned the Crown of Fangs.

## The Time God.

The party is phased and shifted to the throne room of Castle Korvosa 3 weeks into the future.

The Hourglass of Time shatters.

Ophelia is possed by the Time God.

Ophelia becomes the Time God‚Äôs new Avatar.

The party are frozen in time, and with their souls infected by the hourglass, the party have no way of fighting back.

This is the most powerful avatar they have ever had due to two reasons.

1. Ophelia was born of the mysterious Korvosa time fracture, making her built as a vessel for the purpose of housing the soul of the Time God.
2. The Time God consumed over 50 souls of the Heroes of Korvosa.

The Time God claims that they did not create the Korvosa Time Fracture but did use their chronal magic to widen the wound in the continuum.

Wacky Mole uses John Vulso‚Äôs memories as a backdoor into the Throne Room.

Along with Wacky Mole is a mysterious figure cloaked in a pale brown coat with an unlit cigarette between his lips.

The cloaked figure reveals his name to be Yah-Thelgaad.

Wacky Mole and Yah-Thelgaad use some sort of magical-technological ritual to temporarily weaken the avatar allowing them to injure the Time God Avatar.

Clutching their wound The Time God Avatar plane-shifts away.

Wacky Mole and Yah-Thelgaad have an unpleasant discussion about ‚Äúpicking sides‚Äù and about Wacky Mole coming out of ‚Äúsemi-retirement‚Äù.

Wacky Mole shakes Yah-Thelgaad‚Äôs hand and they wish each other the best before departing.

## Conclusion.

Philip the Skeletal Ooze-kin Swashbuckler becomes the bodyguard and jester of the newly crowned Queen Cressida Croft.

Ivar becomes the Blackjack full-time, using his demi-plane gained from a harrow card as his Blackjack lair.

Korvosa is in safe hands now thanks to Ivar‚Äôs power and Vencarlo Vinisari‚Äôs mentorship.

John Vulso becomes the Zon-Kuthon Bat-Guardian of the Star Tower of Castle Scarwall.

His friends and D‚ÄôBear think about him every day, especially on taco Tuesdays.

Ophelia is now the vessel of the Avatar of time.

Ophelia is one of the most powerful individuals in the multi-verse and yet is a prisoner in her own body.

Inside her soul prison, she has only the comfort of her pet wolf named dog to help drown out the endless dying screams of the thousands of previous vessels, echoing all around her.

The Time God wants to escape the effects of Doomsday.

Will they?

Zillith returned to Death‚Äôs Domain, another mission completed.

‚Ä¶and Trinia went back to painting, she has a lot of ideas she recently acquired from recent events.

## Lore Explanation.

The hourglass of time is a mysterious artefact granted to the party by a very powerful, mysterious patron.

Despite the oddness of the behaviours and powers of the hourglass,
it has granted the party the power of dual-class and has brought several adventurers to the party from around the world.

Now the hourglass seems to be much more active,
shuffling players in and out of its inner time-locked demi-plane at will,
with little to no explanation and is far more frequently bringing new adventures into the fold.

The hourglass also seems
to be filling the minds of these new adventures immediately with visions of the adventures of the Heroes of Korvosa,
alerting the noobs to the seriousness of the Quest that they are undertaking.

With the hourglass being the source of much of the Heroes‚Äô powers (the powers they need to finish their quest),
it looks like the Heroes of Korvosa much trust in their patron having goals that align with their own.

## THE SPIRIT‚ÄôS SONG.

Fate of steel‚ÄîSerithtial
Her cage for years sustained.

Four enthralled in lost Scarwall;
Undead to keep her chained.

A spirit first, red war his thirst
Still stands at post of old;
A second foe, infernal soul
Waits high in tower cold.

In kennel‚Äôs grime, third bides his time
Then vents his killing breath.
And on a stone ‚Äômid ash and bone,

The final dreams of death.

The spirits worn and battle-torn
And locked in their damnation,
The chained one‚Äôs hold, at last, grows old
And ushers in salvation.

Yet hope remains amid the chains
When blade‚Äôs stone cage has crumbled,
Friends to dread and death of the dead,
Keys to Kazavon humbled.

This was sung by Zellara at the top of the Bolt during the Ritual of the Ancestors with the Sun Shaman.

## Ophelia Lamora Vulso‚Äôs Backstory.

Part 1.

Ophelia Lamora Vulso.
Ophelia Lamora's origins are difficult to explain because she is a bootstrap paradox.
Ophelia remembers a slightly different world than the one she has appeared in.
Ophelia knows a world where her father John Vulso had fallen in love in the year 4780 Absolem Reckoning.
John Vulso had fallen in love with the Artificer-Cleric Idla Luna-Dream.
5 years later John and Idla conceived Ophelia.
Ophelia grew up in the city of Korvosa.
Ophelia enjoyed fighting from range but disliked the feel of firearms.Instead she trained with her farher John in the way of the crossbow.
Idla requested her fellow acolytes train Ophelia in the way of the healer, so that Ophelia could help heal the wounds of the people of this city whilst also showing Ophelia upfront the damage caused by conflict.
Then there is Wacky Mole, who upon learning of Ophelia's love of crossbows he delved into an ancient vault beneath Korvosa, returning with a long lost formula apparently made by the alchemist of the sun orchid elixir.
Wacky crafted Ophelia a gadget crossbow.
The other difference about this world was the instabilities.Tears in reality where a fusion of nature-time magic ‚ú® caused strange structures, creatures and effects to speak forth.
These tears seem absent from the world that Ophelia finds herself in now.
Ophelia was always told, as everyone is, to stay away from the tears.
No one wanted to enter them anyways, except perhaps the most insane of casters.
Ophelia heard the voice, the voice of a soul with a million voices.
Ophelia entered the tear local to Korvosa and entered a blue-green glowing forest of infinite magical possibilities.
It is here she met her pet wolf, 
a spirit of time magic that outside the tear manifests as what seems like a common wolf, but when you look just a little too close into his eyes you can see a light from beyond this world.
Ophelia made many trips to the tear, eventually learning to use some of the leyline's energies.
The whispers told Ophelia that the time was coming, the time to save her father, to defeat a great evil not present in Ophelia's world.
If Ophelia did not do this, her father and mother would die, and yet not the father and mother that she knew.
Ophelia saw through time, Ophelia saw blood, death, destruction and suffering.
Ophelia leaped through time, into the infinite.

Part 2.

Ophelia's journey to the prime material plane was not as the whispers suggested it would be.
The moment that Ophelia left this branching time stream, it collapsed, as if it had never been.
It is clear, thanks to Ophelia's exposure to the time tear that Ophelia has been born into a branch of the time stream of the prime material plane.
Her world was gone but then again, it has never truly existed, it was merely a possibility.
Additional Ophelia would be aware that time streams are not natural, they are made.Something, someone had crafted Ophelia using an insane amount of magic.Why?
Ophelia was meant to manifest at the beginning of the events of the Crimson Throne campaign.
Unfortunately the academy of Korvosa, a prestigious magic school had unfortunately decided to open a Planar portal at the moment of Ophelia's scheduled manifestation.
The little girl who opened the portal got dosed with huge amounts of magical radiation and became infected with chrono magic.
This tiefling girl gained the hourglass of time and carried it with her until eventually succumbing to the radiation and becoming one of many souls that the hourglass of time would come to collect.
Ophelia's landing time would come later, much later.

Part 3.

The hourglass of time, a physical form of the world that Ophelia came from.All that was left. And yet the hourglass is more.It contains sparks of divinity.
Ophelia has only just set her eyes on it for the first time and yet Ophelia had known it her entire time.
The hourglass was part of her, it always had been.
Seeing her reflection in the hourglass feels spiritual, she is seeing her soul when she does this.She is the hourglass, the hourglass is her.
During this suspension of time Ophelia's wolf, the only other survivor merged with Ophelia's soul.
This caused something strange.Ophelia's aasimarian genetics üß¨ left her body as something else replaced it.
Her halo disappeared.Her wings vanished.Yet when she gazed upon the city as she was suspended in time, Ophelia could see possibilities, pasts, presents and futures happening all around.
Time magic is forbidden by the laws of magic.Time magic is impossible.Time magic is Ophelia's speciality.

Part 4.

The hourglass hadn't created the wound in time.
The creator of the hourglass, the creator of the tear, the meddler behind all of this was not responsible for the tear in time.
They were, however, going to make the most of it.
They had sensed the facture in the bones of time, and they were willing to break that bone to further that objective.
Sabina's defeat.
This battle is one of the most important battles in history for many, many reasons.
The wound in time seems to be festering as the Crimson Throne comes to an end, and the Sabina fight is a puncture in this festering.
Ophelia Lamora Vulso grabbed the hourglass of time and pushed through.
She arrived in front of a father she doesn't know and who doesn't know her.
Ophelia sees a vision of Idla, a woman who in Ophelia's memories had loved her father dearly.
Now?
She had only been acquaintances.
Ophelia's memories were as good as lies.
What about now?
Why was she here?
Only one thing for it.
Time to close the wound.
Time to kill a Queen.

## History of Korvosa.

History of Korvosa.

Korvosa is the eldest of Varisia's three city-states.
The other city-states are Magnimar and Riddleport.

Korvosa was once part of Imperial Cheliax but is now independent.

Korvosa was originally to serve as no more than a defensive position from which settlers and explorers would enter Varisia.

Korvosa only grew into the cosmopolitan centre of trade that it is today with the passage of time and events.

Founding of Korvosa.

Before the arrival of the Empire of Cheliax, Korvosa was a site sacred to the Shoanti.

The location, which included an ancient flat-topped pyramid called the Grand Mastaba,
was of great importance to the Shoanti, even though they had forgotten why.

4407 AR.

Field Marshal Jakthion Korvosa commanded a group of Chelish marines/
Field Marshal Jakthion Korvosa selected the site to begin the construction of a defensive outpost.

Once completed, Fort Korvosa acted as a common stop for explorers, settlers, and trappers operating in the region.

4429 AR.

A Shoanti raiding force burned much of Fort Korvosa in what would become known as the Great Fire.

4438 AR.

The trading post and its wooden defences were replaced by stone and mortar ones.

The Cousins' War.

4502 AR.
The Cousins' War began.
The result of an insult directed at one of Korvosa's noble families.
The conflict heralded the end of the settlement's significance as a military position
but also resulted in the growth of both its population and economic power.
Soon after, Korvosa was seen as a true colony of the Empire of Cheliax.

Harse.

4563 AR.
The nearby village of Harse was founded on the banks of the Falcon River.
Harse has served not only as a stopping-off point for dwarven merchants travelling downstream to the Varisian Gulf but as an entry city for Korvosa's hinterlands located farther north and west.

Death of Aroden.

4606 AR.
The death of the deity Aroden resulted in the civil war in Cheliax;
many of the Empire's colonies, including Korvosa, suffered as their connection to the homeland unexpectedly disappeared.

The city's government has succeeded in achieving some measure of prosperity since the Empire's decline,
but the city's recovery from the chaos that resulted as a result of the Empire's sudden absence has been slow;
its population is but a fraction of what most would expect given a settlement of Korvosa's physical size.

Biston.

The town of Biston on the shores of Lake Syrantula was founded by the independent Korvosan Jhenni Biston,
but soon came under the sway of the larger city.
Tensions between the settlements continued to grow.

4658 AR
Biston finally erupted into open rebellion in, when Biston declared its independence, led by Jhenni's grandson, Randas.
The Korvosan government reacted quite forcefully to this challenge to its authority,
sending half of the Sable Company and a regiment of Korvosan Guards,
which quickly put down the rebels.
Its leaders were dragged back to Korvosa and were summarily executed for treason, and put the town under martial law,
which was lifted only recently.

Kaer Maga

45th century AR
The leaders of Korvosa became aware of the presence of the ancient city of Kaer Maga soon after the founding of the city.
The leaders took an immediate dislike to the anarchic settlement.
Tensions simmered for centuries.

4663 AR
Finally, they came to a crescendo when King Chadris sent an entire regiment of Korvosan Guard to besiege the cliff-side city.
The siege lasted for two months and resulted in the death of hundreds of Korvosans with thousands more injured,
but led to a negotiated truce and the signing of the Treaty of Sirathu.

The treaty stipulated that Kaer Maga would relinquish any control over the lowlands regions of Varisia,
most notably the village of Sirathu.
Since its signing, the truce has held and trade (largely of illegal goods) has continued between the two settlements ever since.

Recent history.

The King is Dead.

The death of King Eodred II caused tremendous upheaval in all of the city's classes.
Not only was it believed that he had been slain by a disease incurable by the best priests of Sarenrae, Abadar, and even Asmodeus, but he was succeeded by his wife, who was seen by the populace of Korvosa as nothing more than a spoiled gold-digger.
