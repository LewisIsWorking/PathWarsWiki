# C06-Verge-Thalorin

> Core.
>> - Question: What is your character's name?
>> - Answer: Verge Thalorin
>> - Question: What does your character's first name mean?
>> - Answer: Verge is a word with layered meaning, chosen intentionally. It refers to a boundary or edge—often of discovery, madness, or transformation. For Verge Thalorin, it reflects his precarious existence on the verge of obsession, genius, or collapse. It hints at his role as someone who investigates the liminal spaces between science and magic, sanity and lunacy, life and death.
>> - Question: What does your character's last name mean?
>> - Answer: Thalorin is an Elven name, possibly derived from ancient elvish roots: "Thal" meaning deep or hidden, referencing hidden knowledge or buried emotion. "Orin" meaning fire or spark, tying into his fireworks technician dedication and alchemical mastery. Together, Thalorin can be interpreted as "hidden flame" or "deep fire," symbolizing restrained brilliance, smoldering pain, or a slow-burning, relentless pursuit of truth.
>> - Question: Does your character have a title? For example, "Arthur, the Dragon knight of Camelot!"
>> - Answer: Yes, though most are whispered or unofficial: The White Ash–A nickname earned from the pale coat and trail of destruction he often leaves behind, usually in flames or scorched remains. Physician of Ruin – A title given by those who fear his healing as much as his harm; his methods often save lives at disturbing cost. The Ashen Seeker – Used among academic circles that know of his past breakthroughs and the personal tragedies tied to them. Investigator Verge – His formal title within official capacities (guilds, city watch, or alchemical orders).

> Age.
>> - Question: How old is your character?
>> - Answer: 120 years old
>> - Question: What year was your character born?
>> - Answer: 4590 AR
>> - Question: What day is your character's birthday?
>> - Answer: 19th of Kuthona (the month of darkness, cold, and the longest night) Kuthona = December equivalent. The 19th falls shortly before Winter Solstice (Night of the Pale), fitting for someone on the edge of light and dark. This date suits an elf marked by isolation, intellect, and sorrow.
>> - Question: At what age did the character become an adventurer?
>> - Answer: Verge began adventuring late by elven standards, as his early years were consumed by obsessive study and research. Age Began Adventuring: 118 years old. This means he started only 2 years ago, driven by a recent, life-altering revelation or catastrophe—perhaps the death of a subject, the theft of forbidden notes, or a lab experiment gone horribly right.

> Class #1.
>> - Question: What is your character's class?
>> - Answer: Investigator Methodology: Empiricism — Verge relies on cold logic, forensic analysis, alchemical tools, and relentless observation. He dissects truth like a surgeon—precise, emotionless… until it's personal.
>> - Question: Does your character enjoy their class?
>> - Answer: No. Need it? Absolutely. Verge treats his investigative work as a compulsion—a duty driven by guilt, obsession, and a desire to understand rather than heal. The work gives him clarity and control in a world that once spiraled into chaos. He takes no pleasure in suffering, but sees solving mysteries, analyzing corpses, or reconstructing tragedies as sacred acts of redemption. So while he may not "enjoy" it in the joyful sense… it is his only anchor.
>> - Question: How did your character become their class?
>> - Answer: Verge was once an alchemical researcher working deep within an elven medical enclave, developing volatile mixtures to accelerate healing and regeneration. But a catastrophic failure—perhaps involving a test subject or loved one—left him disfigured and emotionally shattered. He abandoned pure alchemy to pursue answers: What went wrong? Why did it happen? What secrets did his mentors hide? The path of the Investigator allowed him to turn that trauma into method—analyzing clues, tracking corruption, and dissecting cause and effect like a living autopsy. His obsession with finding truth, no matter the cost, naturally evolved into empiricist investigation.
>> - Question: Who trained your character in their class?
>> - Answer: He had no formal instructor—his training was self-forged, honed through loss and necessity. However, a few figures left their mark: Elarian Siltvein, a cold, calculating elven forensic examiner who introduced Verge to anatomical deduction and corpse-reading. Verge later surpassed and openly rejected his methods as inhumane. The Inquest of Ildareth, a secretive elven think-tank dedicated to logical problem-solving through cold empiricism. Verge devoured their rejected case files and rogue theories, piecing together their failures to create his own refined process. His own shattered journals, scribbled during his breakdown, became manuals—he now treats them as scripture.

> Class #2.
>> - Question: What will/is your character's 2nd class be?
>> - Answer: Alchemist
>> - Question: Does/Will your character enjoy their 2nd class?
>> - Answer: Not in the traditional sense. Alchemy is both his gift and his curse. He once believed it would change the world—for good. But now he sees it as a dangerous tool that must be wielded with meticulous precision. He respects the alchemical arts, but views them with deep suspicion. Every potion is a temptation. Every formula is a memory. He uses alchemy like a surgeon uses a scalpel: carefully, coldly, and only when necessary.

> Race
>> - Question: What is your character's Race?
>> - Answer: Elf
>> - Question: What is your character's Sub-Race?
>> - Answer: Ancient Elf
>> - Question: Has your character met other members of their race?
>> - Answer: Yes, extensively. As an ancient elf, Verge was born and raised within an elven society—likely in a secluded, knowledge-focused enclave known for medicine, arcane experimentation, or both. He spent decades surrounded by other elves: scholars, physicians, alchemists, and thinkers. Some were mentors. Some were rivals. Some are now dead—or worse, missing, due to the consequences of their collective work. He has also encountered other elves while traveling: aloof diplomats, xenophobic wood elves, or cold technomancers. While he is one of them, he is also alienated from them.
>> - Question: Does your character like your race?
>> - Answer: Not especially. Verge has grown disillusioned with his people. He sees elven society as stagnant, self-congratulatory, and often paralyzed by its own perfectionism. Their slow decision-making and obsession with aesthetics repulse him now. He believes it was that very arrogance that led to the disaster that scarred him—elves too proud to admit they were wrong. He doesn't hate them, but views them with cool detachment, rarely identifying with their traditions anymore.
>> - Question: Does your character like any races in particular? Why?
>> - Answer: Yes, though he'd never say so aloud: Humans – Their urgency and emotional rawness intrigue him. He sees in them the passion and recklessness he once lacked. Many of his current allies or informants are human. He learns from their short-lived brilliance. Dwarves – Their precision, discipline, and craftsmanship resonate with his alchemical sensibilities. He has a quiet respect for their resilience and how they handle grief and honor—often better than elves. Gnomes – He finds them frustratingly chaotic, but he secretly admires their creativity and sheer disregard for tradition. Their approach to innovation feels closer to what alchemy should be.
>> - Question: Does your character hate any races in particular? Why?
>> - Answer: He doesn't hate any race by default, but he has deep distrust or discomfort around: Elves in positions of unchecked power – He sees them as reminders of the institutions that failed him. Fiend-tainted ancestries (Tieflings, cambions, etc.) – Not hatred, but unease. His past experiments may have involved planar energies or corruption, so seeing those touched by infernal blood puts him on edge. Creatures that defy natural law (ghouls, fleshwarped, undead) – His investigative work has shown him the line between life and death must be respected. Anything that blurs it too far is met with clinical hostility.

> Parents and Family.
>> - Question: Where was your character born?
>> - Answer: Born in: Telveth Enclave — a hidden, high-altitude elven settlement nestled in the shattered cliffs of the Verduran Forest's western rim (in modern-day Taldor). Telveth was a reclusive medical and magical research commune, focused on healing, longevity, and mental clarity. Its members were perfectionist scholars, and Verge was born into the cold brilliance of their halls.
>> - Question: Where were you raised?
>> - Answer: Raised in: Telveth Enclave, entirely. He spent his first century inside those halls—within white marble towers and sterile labs filled with soft candlelight, quiet rituals, and gentle cruelty masked as "discipline." His world was observation, alchemical theory, anatomy scrolls, and emotional suppression. He never saw the outside world until long after the disaster that scarred him.
>> - Question: Who raised your characters?
>> - Answer: Raised by: A collective of scholars, not parents in the traditional sense. Verge was treated as a prodigy, passed between mentors and instructors like a prized project. Emotional bonds were considered distractions. Archmistress Virellen — A surgeon-educator who treated Verge more as a tool than a student. She praised results, punished emotion. Alchemist Tharellis — A cold, alchemy-obsessed mentor who encouraged Verge's risk-taking in formula design. Disappeared under mysterious circumstances after an accident in their lab—one Verge never speaks of. Archivist Dathinor — The closest thing to a father-figure, though even he remained distant. Gave Verge his first journal and taught him the value of recording everything. Later deemed Verge "unstable" and requested his exile.
>> - Question: Who are your parents?
>> - Answer: Verge knows their names—but not their faces. He was told early on that his parents had "donated" him to the Enclave's research program at birth, seeing more promise in intellectual legacy than familial connection. Mother: Silenira Thalorin – A mind-healer and empath who allegedly couldn't bond with her son due to emotional projection disorders. Father: Elandor Vanneth – A runeweaver and scribe whose records were sealed after a major "containment breach" decades ago. Rumor has it that one or both were involved in experimental memory editing or psychic extraction. Verge suspects they may have altered or removed parts of his own memory in infancy—and that the cost of that is written somewhere in the scars on his mind and arms.
>> - Question: What are your parents' names?
>> - Answer: Mother: Silenira Thalorin, Father: Elandor Vanneth. Verge carries his mother's surname, Thalorin, though it was chosen more for its academic prestige than emotional lineage.
>> - Question: Are your parents alive?
>> - Answer: Uncertain. Official records list both parents as "retired to deep meditation", a euphemism often used by elven intellectual enclaves to cover deaths, disappearances, or self-imposed psychic exile. Verge suspects at least one is still alive, possibly operating under a false identity or buried deep within a hidden research order. He's never pursued the truth directly—perhaps out of fear of what he might find.
>> - Question: What did your parents do for a living?
>> - Answer: Silenira Thalorin: Mental Empath & Psychic Surgeon. Silenira was a specialist in emotional regulation, often tasked with performing psychic surgeries on unstable minds—editing memories, suppressing trauma, and severing harmful emotional ties. Cold and brilliant, she viewed attachment as a flaw, including maternal instinct. Elandor Vanneth: Runeweaver, Record-Keeper, and Forbidden Linguist. Elandor was obsessed with ancient languages and arcane structures that influenced thought. He designed containment wards and mnemonic sigils, many of which were banned after an incident involving a vault breach and multiple staff disappearances. His personal records are sealed. Together, they were part of a highly secretive experimental division within Telveth. Their work may have laid the groundwork for the mental fractures Verge now studies in others—and suffers from himself.
>> - Question: Do you have any other family or friends?
>> - Answer: Family: None close. Elven families often drift apart over decades. Verge might have distant cousins or forgotten siblings within the enclave, but no known bonds remain. Friends: Lucen Marr (Human, deceased) – A short-lived human investigator who once worked with Verge in the outer world. Lucen treated Verge as a friend and peer. He died under mysterious circumstances involving a failed ritual—something Verge rarely speaks of. Faeril Venn (Gnome, alive) – A pyrotechnics engineer and chaos-minded alchemist who once co-developed experimental fireworks with Verge. They occasionally exchange volatile letters and chemical recipes. Kalthis (Tiefling, status unknown) – A morally gray information broker who once saved Verge's life. Verge both distrusts and respects them—and may owe them a favor.

> Love.
>> - Question: What is your character's sexuality?
>> - Answer: Straight — Verge experiences attraction toward women, though rarely and with deep internal conflict. His emotional repression, trauma, and obsessive mind often override or suppress desire entirely.
>> - Question: What is your character's marital status?
>> - Answer: Single — Intentionally so. Verge avoids intimacy not out of fear, but because he believes closeness is dangerous—for both parties. Love, in his eyes, is a variable he cannot control.
>> - Question: Does your character have kids?
>> - Answer: No. He has never fathered children, nor has he ever been part of a relationship close enough to result in one.
>> - Question: Does your character want kids?
>> - Answer: No. He believes his legacy is intellectual, not biological. He fears passing down whatever damage or darkness he carries within him. Creating life would be an act of arrogance he cannot justify
>> - Question: Is your character in love?
>> - Answer: No. His heart is scarred in the same way his body is—closed off, guarded, and focused entirely on his grim purpose. Even fleeting affection is analyzed, dissected, and discarded.
>> - Question: Has your character ever been in love?
>> - Answer: No. Verge has felt fascination, admiration, even fleeting tenderness—but never allowed himself to fall into genuine love. Part of him wonders if he's even capable of it anymore… or if the chance was stolen from him long ago by the experiments and traumas he can't fully remember.

> The Mind | Thoughts and Feelings.
>> - Question: What is your character's alignment?
>> - Answer: Neutral (bordering on Neutral Good). Verge is driven not by laws, chaos, or divine decree, but by truth and personal ethics. He follows reason, data, and observation. He helps others when it aligns with his investigative purpose—but is willing to break rules, laws, and even taboos to uncover the truth or stop suffering at its root. He avoids cruelty, but he's not afraid to get his hands dirty. If the law hides the truth, he breaks it. If kindness impedes the solution, he sets it aside. But if a life can be saved—he saves it.
>> - Question: What is your character's moral code?
>> - Answer: Verge operates under a self-made, brutal, and clinical moral code: Truth above comfort. Lies—even kind ones—are rot. Suffering must be understood to be ended. Study pain; do not turn away. No knowledge is forbidden. Only what one does with it. No life is disposable. But no life is above examination. Redemption is real, but not free. You must earn it in blood, failure, and truth. He views morality like surgery: sometimes brutal cuts must be made to heal deeper wounds.
>> - Question: Does your character have goals?
>> - Answer: Yes—Verge's life is defined by his goals, both personal and professional: Short-Term Goals: Uncover the full truth behind the Telveth Enclave disaster that left him scarred. Track and neutralize rogue alchemists or investigators abusing forbidden knowledge. Reconstruct his missing memories—possibly altered by his own parents or mentors. Long-Term Goals: Create a perfect method of forensic alchemy to reveal any truth, anywhere, no matter how buried. Prevent the misuse of alchemy and psychic surgery through knowledge, not control. Discover whether consciousness itself can be recorded and restored—perhaps as a way to undo past losses or preserve fragile genius.
>> - Question: Does your character follow a God?
>> - Answer: No. Verge is secular, bordering on anti-theistic. He believes gods are powerful entities, but not infallible or morally superior. He's seen too many tragedies justified by divine will to place his trust in one. He respects those who find purpose through faith, but he trusts logic, science, and observation far more than prayer.
>> - Question: What God (if any) does your character follow?
>> - Answer: None
>> - Question: What are your character's personal beliefs?
>> - Answer: Verge's worldview is shaped by logic, scars, and sorrow. He believes: Everything has a reason — Every murder, every disaster, every madness—there is always a cause. His life is devoted to uncovering it. Emotion without discipline is dangerous — Passion, grief, and fear cloud judgment. He believes feelings must be studied, not surrendered to. Ignorance is the true evil — Not chaos, not evil gods, not monsters. It's ignorance that breeds tragedy. You cannot fix the world, but you can document the rot — He doesn't try to change fate, but he refuses to let it go unexamined. People lie. Scars don't. — He trusts physical evidence, chemical residue, and behavioral patterns more than anyone's words.
>> - Question: Does your character have any personality quirks?
>> - Answer: Yes. Verge's trauma and investigative habits manifest in subtle, often unsettling ways: Records everything — He constantly scribbles in pocket journals. Case notes, anatomical sketches, emotionally detached observations. Even casual conversations get logged. Talks to himself — Not in full dialogue, but in short, clinical phrases: "Contamination. Residue. Repeat the sequence." Stares too long — He'll fixate on injuries, behavior, or lies with surgical coldness, often making others uncomfortable. Smells chemicals — He instinctively lifts vials, cloth, or bodies to his nose—not out of habit, but from training. He even does this with food or flowers. Hates unwashed hands — He'll clean or glove his own multiple times a day, even when not working. Doesn't blink when emotionally stressed — The more disturbed or triggered he gets, the calmer and stiller he becomes. It's unnerving.
>> - Question: Are they anti-social?
>> - Answer: Yes—but not entirely. Verge is socially distant, not because he hates people, but because he doesn't trust easy connection. He keeps others at arm's length for two reasons: He's afraid of hurting them or being hurt. He's constantly analyzing them like subjects. He can function in social settings, even charm when necessary, but it's usually strategic. He's more comfortable with corpses, lab equipment, or observation notes than with small talk or camaraderie.
>> - Question: Are they Arrogant?
>> - Answer: No—but he's perceived that way. Verge is intensely self-assured in his methods and intellect. He rarely doubts his logic, and he doesn't soften truths to spare feelings. To others, this can come across as arrogance, but he's not boastful. In fact, he often doubts his morality—just not his deduction. He knows he's intelligent. He also knows that intelligence has cost him everything.
>> - Question: Are they Optimistic?
>> - Answer: Absolutely not. Verge is a pessimist—or more accurately, a realist pushed to the edge of cynicism. He doesn't believe things get better on their own. He expects the worst from people and systems and is rarely surprised by betrayal, decay, or tragedy. That said, a small, buried part of him hopes he's wrong—and that sliver is what keeps him going.
>> - Question: Are They Paranoid?
>> - Answer: Yes—but it's earned. Verge has seen how quickly people can lie, how mentors betray students, how institutions collapse from within. He is constantly evaluating risk, checking for inconsistencies, and preparing for betrayal. It's not wild or conspiratorial paranoia—it's methodical, controlled vigilance. But it still isolates him. He sleeps lightly, locks his journals, and rarely shows his full hand—because he knows someone is always watching, or worse… remembering what he forgot.
>> - Question: Why does your character adventure?
>> - Answer: Verge does not adventure for gold, glory, or wanderlust. He adventures to uncover buried truths, dismantle hidden dangers, and investigate the rot beneath civilization's surface. Each case, corpse, or catastrophe he encounters is another piece of a larger mystery—one that may tie back to his lost memories, his parents' secrets, or the disaster that ruined the Telveth Enclave. Every broken system he exposes or dangerous formula he neutralizes is a step toward preventing what happened to him from happening to someone else. He doesn't see the world as a battlefield. He sees it as a crime scene.
>> - Question: How does your character view his/her role as an adventurer?
>> - Answer: Verge doesn't call himself an "adventurer." That word implies romance and bravado, which he despises. Instead, he sees himself as: A forensic surgeon on a dying world. A witness to the truths others are too afraid to face. A scalpel, not a sword—meant to cut with precision, not destroy blindly. To Verge, his role is to observe, understand, and surgically intervene when necessary. If monsters must be fought, fine. If allies need healing, so be it. But everything is in service to the deeper truth beneath the surface.
>> - Question: How does your character get along with others?
>> - Answer: Cautiously, clinically, and often awkwardly. Verge tends to be: Distant — Keeps people at arm's length emotionally. Blunt — Tells people the truth, whether they want it or not. Efficient — Prefers action and evidence over debate or posturing. Loyal—but only when trust is earned — If someone proves themselves reliable and doesn't lie to him, Verge will risk his life for them—quietly and without hesitation. That said, he does not handle warmth or emotional vulnerability well. If someone shows him kindness, he often responds with uncomfortable silence, mild confusion, or a deflection into cold analysis. Verge works well in a team, as long as: He's respected for his skill. His boundaries are honored. And no one tries to force him into emotional openness
>> - Question: Is there anything that your character hates?
>> - Answer: Deeply: Willful ignorance — People who refuse to learn or understand infuriate him more than murderers. Mindless optimism — "Everything happens for a reason" enrages him. To Verge, everything happens for a cause, and pretending otherwise is cowardice. Hypocrisy in healers — Clerics, physicians, or alchemists who hide behind virtue while doing harm. Senseless cruelty — He's not above using pain, but cruelty for cruelty's sake? That breaks his code. And on a smaller note: Syrupy perfume, overly strong scents—they cloud his perception. Fleshwarped creations—they remind him of what alchemy should never become.
>> - Question: Is there anything that your character fears?
>> - Answer: Yes—though he'd never admit it out loud. Losing his mind — After years of psychic tampering, experimentation, and trauma, Verge fears he is slowly unraveling. Every time he forgets a name or misreads a detail, he wonders: Was that me… or something broken? Becoming like his mentors — Cold. Detached. Sacrificing lives for theory. He walks that edge every day and fears he may already be over it. Love — Not because he's unfeeling, but because he knows it makes him vulnerable. He fears not being able to protect someone—again. Magic he cannot explain — Not because it's arcane, but because it defies evidence. Verge relies on patterns, and true randomness or divine will is his worst-case scenario. Finding out his parents were right. That everything he is—the trauma, the scars, the cold detachment—was intentional.
>> - Question: What sin does your character align with closest? Greed, Pride, Lust, Envy, Gluttony, Wrath or Sloth?
>> - Answer: Pride. But not pride in beauty or fame—intellectual pride. Verge believes in his own mind above all else. He trusts logic, deduction, and his methodology more than the gods, governments, or even his companions. He does not boast, but his pride is more dangerous because it's quiet, rationalized. He tells himself: "I'm the only one who sees clearly. If I don't act, no one will." This has led him to: Overstep moral lines in the name of "truth." Disregard others' opinions when they contradict his logic. View emotion and spirituality as flaws or indulgences. His greatest flaw isn't cruelty—it's certainty.
>> - Question: What apocalypse would your character most likely cause: War, Famine, Pestilence or Death?
>> - Answer: Pestilence. Verge would never intend to bring ruin—but through his relentless pursuit of forbidden knowledge or a desperate experiment to understand life, memory, or consciousness, he could unleash something virulent—a disease of the mind, a soul-corrupting alchemical agent, or a truth so unbearable it shatters minds. It would not be a plague of the body alone. It would be something more insidious—something that rots reason, like a cognitive virus or forensic toxin that erodes memory, morality, or identity. "I only wanted to understand… I didn't mean to let it out."
