# C06-Verge-Thalorin

> Out of character.
>> - Question: Player Name?
>> - Answer: (Player Name)
>> - Question: Campaign Name?
>> - Answer: Kibwe

> Core.
>> - Question: What is your character's name?
>> - Answer: Verge Thalorin
>> - Question: What does your character's first name mean?
>> - Answer: Verge is a word with layered meaning, chosen intentionally. It refers to a boundary or edge—often of discovery, madness, or transformation. For Verge Thalorin, it reflects his precarious existence on the verge of obsession, genius, or collapse. It hints at his role as someone who investigates the liminal spaces between science and magic, sanity and lunacy, life and death.
>> - Question: What does your character's last name mean?
>> - Answer: Thalorin is an Elven name, possibly derived from ancient elvish roots: "Thal" meaning deep or hidden, referencing hidden knowledge or buried emotion. "Orin" meaning fire or spark, tying into his fireworks technician dedication and alchemical mastery. Together, Thalorin can be interpreted as "hidden flame" or "deep fire," symbolizing restrained brilliance, smoldering pain, or a slow-burning, relentless pursuit of truth.
>> - Question: Does your character have a title? For example, "Arthur, the Dragon knight of Camelot!"
>> - Answer: Yes, though most are whispered or unofficial: The White Ash – A nickname earned from the pale coat and trail of destruction he often leaves behind, usually in flames or scorched remains. Physician of Ruin – A title given by those who fear his healing as much as his harm; his methods often save lives at disturbing cost. The Ashen Seeker – Used among academic circles that know of his past breakthroughs and the personal tragedies tied to them. Investigator Verge – His formal title within official capacities (guilds, city watch, or alchemical orders). The Curse-Touched – A newer whisper among those who know of his connection to the Curse Breaker statue.

> Age.
>> - Question: How old is your character?
>> - Answer: 120 years old
>> - Question: What year was your character born?
>> - Answer: 4590 AR
>> - Question: What day is your character's birthday?
>> - Answer: 19th of Kuthona (the month of darkness, cold, and longest night). The 19th falls shortly before Winter Solstice (Night of the Pale), fitting for someone on the edge of light and dark. This date suits an elf marked by isolation, intellect, and sorrow.
>> - Question: At what age did the character become an adventurer?
>> - Answer: Verge began adventuring late by elven standards, at 118 years old. This means he started only 2 years ago, driven by a recent, life-altering revelation about the Curse Breaker statue and his connection to the failed experiments at Telveth Enclave. His "adventuring" began when he tracked the statue's theft to Kibwe, realizing it might hold the key to understanding his own cursed condition.

> Class #1.
>> - Question: What is your character's class?
>> - Answer: Investigator (Methodology: Empiricism) — Verge relies on cold logic, forensic analysis, alchemical tools, and relentless observation. He dissects truth like a surgeon—precise, emotionless… until it's personal.
>> - Question: Does your character enjoy their class?
>> - Answer: No. Need it? Absolutely. Verge treats his investigative work as a compulsion—a duty driven by guilt, obsession, and a desire to understand rather than heal. The work gives him clarity and control in a world that once spiraled into chaos. He takes no pleasure in suffering, but sees solving mysteries, analyzing corpses, or reconstructing tragedies as sacred acts of redemption. So while he may not "enjoy" it in the joyful sense… it is his only anchor.
>> - Question: How did your character become their class?
>> - Answer: Verge was once an alchemical researcher working deep within the Telveth Enclave, developing volatile mixtures to accelerate healing and regeneration. But a catastrophic failure involving the misuse of curse-breaking artifacts—possibly connected to the original Curse Breaker statue—left him disfigured and emotionally shattered. He abandoned pure alchemy to pursue answers: What went wrong? Why did it happen? What secrets did his mentors hide about the ancient statues? The path of the Investigator allowed him to turn that trauma into method—analyzing clues, tracking corruption, and dissecting cause and effect like a living autopsy.
>> - Question: Who trained your character in their class?
>> - Answer: He had no formal instructor—his training was self-forged, honed through loss and necessity. However, a few figures left their mark: Elarian Siltvein, a cold, calculating elven forensic examiner who introduced Verge to anatomical deduction and corpse-reading. Verge later surpassed and openly rejected his methods as inhumane. The Inquest of Ildareth, a secretive elven think-tank dedicated to logical problem-solving through cold empiricism. Verge devoured their rejected case files and rogue theories, piecing together their failures to create his own refined process. His own shattered journals, scribbled during his breakdown, became manuals—he now treats them as scripture.

> Class #2.
>> - Question: What will/is your character's 2nd class be?
>> - Answer: Alchemist (granted by his connection to the Curse Breaker statue)
>> - Question: Does/Will your character enjoy their 2nd class?
>> - Answer: Not in the traditional sense. Alchemy is both his gift and his curse. He once believed it would change the world—for good. But now he sees it as a dangerous tool that must be wielded with meticulous precision. He respects the alchemical arts, but views them with deep suspicion. Every potion is a temptation. Every formula is a memory. The Curse Breaker's influence has awakened dormant alchemical potential within him, but he fears what this connection might cost. He uses alchemy like a surgeon uses a scalpel: carefully, coldly, and only when necessary.

> Race
>> - Question: What is your character's Race?
>> - Answer: Elf
>> - Question: What is your character's Sub-Race?
>> - Answer: Ancient Elf
>> - Question: Has your character met other members of their race?
>> - Answer: Yes, extensively. As an ancient elf, Verge was born and raised within elven society—specifically in the secluded Telveth Enclave known for medicine and arcane experimentation. He spent decades surrounded by other elves: scholars, physicians, alchemists, and thinkers. Some were mentors. Some were rivals. Some are now dead—or worse, missing, due to the consequences of their collective work. He has also encountered other elves while traveling: aloof diplomats, xenophobic wood elves, or cold technomancers. While he is one of them, he is also alienated from them. In Kibwe, he has met few elves, as most avoid the cursed city.
>> - Question: Does your character like your race?
>> - Answer: Not especially. Verge has grown disillusioned with his people. He sees elven society as stagnant, self-congratulatory, and often paralyzed by its own perfectionism. Their slow decision-making and obsession with aesthetics repulse him now. He believes it was that very arrogance that led to the disaster that scarred him—elves too proud to admit they were wrong about curse-breaking magic. He doesn't hate them, but views them with cool detachment, rarely identifying with their traditions anymore.
>> - Question: Does your character like any races in particular? Why?
>> - Answer: Yes, though he'd never say so aloud: Humans (before the curse) – Their urgency and emotional rawness intrigued him. He saw in them the passion and recklessness he once lacked. Ironically, his arrival in Kibwe to help save the humans from their slime transformation has given his mission personal weight. Dwarves – Their precision, discipline, and craftsmanship resonate with his alchemical sensibilities. He has a quiet respect for their resilience and how they handle grief and honor. Gnomes – He finds them frustratingly chaotic, but secretly admires their creativity and sheer disregard for tradition. Their approach to innovation feels closer to what alchemy should be. Ratfolk – Their pragmatic approach to survival and adaptability reminds him of his own methods.
>> - Question: Does your character hate any races in particular? Why?
>> - Answer: He doesn't hate any race by default, but he has deep distrust or discomfort around: Elves in positions of unchecked power – He sees them as reminders of the institutions that failed him. Fiend-tainted ancestries (Tieflings, cambions, etc.) – Not hatred, but unease. His past experiments may have involved planar energies or corruption, and the demonic influences in Xatramba put him deeply on edge. Creatures that defy natural law (ghouls, fleshwarped, undead, slimes) – His investigative work has shown him the line between life and death must be respected. The slime transformation affecting Kibwe's humans represents everything he fears about unchecked magical corruption.

> Parents and Family.
>> - Question: Where was your character born?
>> - Answer: Born in: Telveth Enclave — a hidden, high-altitude elven settlement nestled in the shattered cliffs of the Verduran Forest's western rim (in modern-day Taldor). Telveth was a reclusive medical and magical research commune, focused on healing, longevity, mental clarity, and the study of ancient curse-breaking artifacts. Its members were perfectionist scholars, and Verge was born into the cold brilliance of their halls.
>> - Question: Where were you raised?
>> - Answer: Raised in: Telveth Enclave, entirely. He spent his first century inside those halls—within white marble towers and sterile labs filled with soft candlelight, quiet rituals, and gentle cruelty masked as "discipline." His world was observation, alchemical theory, anatomy scrolls, and emotional suppression. He never saw the outside world until long after the disaster that scarred him and forced his exile.
>> - Question: Who raised your characters?
>> - Answer: Raised by: A collective of scholars, not parents in the traditional sense. Verge was treated as a prodigy, passed between mentors and instructors like a prized project. Emotional bonds were considered distractions. Archmistress Virellen — A surgeon-educator who treated Verge more as a tool than a student. She praised results, punished emotion. Specialized in curse-breaking surgical techniques. Alchemist Tharellis — A cold, alchemy-obsessed mentor who encouraged Verge's risk-taking in formula design. Disappeared under mysterious circumstances after an accident involving curse-breaking artifacts—one Verge never speaks of. Archivist Dathinor — The closest thing to a father-figure, though even he remained distant. Gave Verge his first journal and taught him the value of recording everything. Later deemed Verge "unstable" and requested his exile after the catastrophic experiment.
>> - Question: Who are your parents?
>> - Answer: Verge knows their names—but not their faces. He was told early on that his parents had "donated" him to the Enclave's research program at birth, seeing more promise in intellectual legacy than familial connection. Mother: Silenira Thalorin – A mind-healer and empath who allegedly couldn't bond with her son due to emotional projection disorders. Specialized in removing traumatic memories and curse-induced madness. Father: Elandor Vanneth – A runeweaver and scribe whose records were sealed after a major "containment breach" involving stolen curse-breaking artifacts. Rumor has it that one or both were involved in experimental memory editing or psychic extraction. Verge suspects they may have altered or removed parts of his own memory in infancy—and that the cost of that is written somewhere in the scars on his mind and arms.
>> - Question: What are your parents' names?
>> - Answer: Mother: Silenira Thalorin, Father: Elandor Vanneth. Verge carries his mother's surname, Thalorin, though it was chosen more for its academic prestige than emotional lineage.
>> - Question: Are your parents alive?
>> - Answer: Uncertain. Official records list both parents as "retired to deep meditation", a euphemism often used by elven intellectual enclaves to cover deaths, disappearances, or self-imposed psychic exile. Verge suspects at least one is still alive, possibly operating under a false identity or buried deep within a hidden research order studying curse-breaking artifacts. He's never pursued the truth directly—perhaps out of fear of what he might find, or what they might remember that he's forgotten.
>> - Question: What did your parents do for a living?
>> - Answer: Silenira Thalorin: Mental Empath & Psychic Surgeon specializing in curse-induced madness. She was tasked with performing psychic surgeries on minds broken by curse exposure—editing memories, suppressing trauma, and severing harmful magical ties. Cold and brilliant, she viewed attachment as a flaw, including maternal instinct. Elandor Vanneth: Runeweaver, Record-Keeper, and Forbidden Linguist specializing in curse-breaking inscription. He was obsessed with ancient languages and arcane structures that influenced cursed objects. He designed containment wards and mnemonic sigils for curse-breaking artifacts, many of which were banned after an incident involving a vault breach and multiple staff disappearances. Together, they were part of a highly secretive experimental division within Telveth that studied the original Curse Breaker statues and their corrupted counterparts.
>> - Question: Do you have any other family or friends?
>> - Answer: Family: None close. Elven families often drift apart over decades. Verge might have distant cousins or forgotten siblings within the enclave, but no known bonds remain. Friends: Lucen Marr (Human, deceased in Kibwe's early curse outbreak) – A short-lived human investigator who once worked with Verge. Lucen treated Verge as a friend and peer. He died in Kibwe trying to study the slime transformation—something that haunts Verge. Faeril Venn (Gnome, alive but distant) – A pyrotechnics engineer and chaos-minded alchemist who once co-developed experimental compounds with Verge. They occasionally exchange volatile letters and chemical recipes. Kalthis (Tiefling, status unknown) – A morally gray information broker who once saved Verge's life and told him about the Curse Breaker statue's theft. Verge both distrusts and respects them—and may owe them a significant favor.

> Love.
>> - Question: What is your character's sexuality?
>> - Answer: Straight — Verge experiences attraction toward women, though rarely and with deep internal conflict. His emotional repression, trauma, and obsessive mind often override or suppress desire entirely. The curse-touched nature of his existence makes him fear that any intimate connection might spread his affliction.
>> - Question: What is your character's marital status?
>> - Answer: Single — Intentionally so. Verge avoids intimacy not out of fear, but because he believes closeness is dangerous—for both parties. Love, in his eyes, is a variable he cannot control, and his curse-touched nature makes him a danger to others.
>> - Question: Does your character have kids?
>> - Answer: No. He has never fathered children, nor has he ever been part of a relationship close enough to result in one.
>> - Question: Does your character want kids?
>> - Answer: No. He believes his legacy is intellectual, not biological. He fears passing down whatever curse or darkness he carries within him. Creating life would be an act of arrogance he cannot justify, especially given his connection to curse-breaking magic gone wrong.
>> - Question: Is your character in love?
>> - Answer: No. His heart is scarred in the same way his body is—closed off, guarded, and focused entirely on his grim purpose. Even fleeting affection is analyzed, dissected, and discarded before it can take root.
>> - Question: Has your character ever been in love?
>> - Answer: Once. Dr. Lyralei Moonwhisper, a fellow researcher at Telveth Enclave who specialized in curse analysis. She was brilliant, passionate about their work, and saw potential for good in their research. She died in the catastrophic experiment that scarred Verge—an experiment she had warned him against. Her death broke something in him that never healed, and he's never allowed himself to feel that deeply again.

> The Mind | Thoughts and Feelings.
>> - Question: What is your character's alignment?
>> - Answer: Neutral (bordering on Neutral Good). Verge is driven not by laws, chaos, or divine decree, but by truth and personal ethics. He follows reason, data, and observation. He helps others when it aligns with his investigative purpose—but is willing to break rules, laws, and even taboos to uncover the truth or stop suffering at its root. He avoids cruelty, but he's not afraid to get his hands dirty. If the law hides the truth, he breaks it. If kindness impedes the solution, he sets it aside. But if a life can be saved—he saves it.
>> - Question: What is your character's moral code?
>> - Answer: Verge operates under a self-made, brutal, and clinical moral code: Truth above comfort. Lies—even kind ones—are rot. Suffering must be understood to be ended. Study pain; do not turn away. No knowledge is forbidden. Only what one does with it. No life is disposable. But no life is above examination. Redemption is real, but not free. You must earn it in blood, failure, and truth. Curses can be broken, but only through understanding their true nature. He views morality like surgery: sometimes brutal cuts must be made to heal deeper wounds.
>> - Question: Does your character have goals?
>> - Answer: Yes—Verge's life is defined by his goals: Immediate Goals: Retrieve the Curse Breaker statue and save Kibwe's population. Understand his connection to the statue and why it grants him dual-class abilities. Investigate the demonic corruption in Xatramba and its connection to curse-breaking magic. Medium-Term Goals: Uncover the full truth behind the Telveth Enclave disaster and Dr. Moonwhisper's death. Track down his missing mentor Tharellis and learn what really happened during the containment breach. Understand the network of Curse Breaker statues and their original purpose. Long-Term Goals: Create a perfect method of curse analysis and breaking that doesn't require devastating sacrifice. Prevent the misuse of curse-breaking magic through knowledge, not suppression. Find a way to honor Dr. Moonwhisper's memory by using their research for genuine good.
>> - Question: Does your character follow a God?
>> - Answer: No. Verge is secular, bordering on anti-theistic. He believes gods are powerful entities, but not infallible or morally superior. He's seen too many tragedies justified by divine will to place his trust in one. However, he has a grudging respect for Sarenrae's sun priests in Kibwe, as they seem genuinely committed to healing rather than dogma.
>> - Question: What God (if any) does your character follow?
>> - Answer: None, though he acknowledges the practical power of divine magic in curse-breaking.
>> - Question: What are your character's personal beliefs?
>> - Answer: Everything has a reason — Every curse, every disaster, every transformation—there is always a cause. His life is devoted to uncovering it. Emotion without discipline is dangerous — Passion, grief, and fear cloud judgment. Feelings must be studied, not surrendered to. Ignorance is the true evil — Not chaos, not demons, not curses. It's ignorance that allows evil to flourish. Knowledge is the only true weapon against suffering. Curses are puzzles, not punishments — Every curse has a solution, a weakness, a key. Finding it requires understanding the curse's origin and purpose. People lie. Evidence doesn't — He trusts physical evidence, magical residue, and behavioral patterns more than anyone's words. Love is the most dangerous curse of all — Because it makes you vulnerable to loss, and loss breaks people in ways they never recover from.
>> - Question: Does your character have any personality quirks?
>> - Answer: Records everything obsessively — He constantly scribbles in pocket journals. Case notes, anatomical sketches, curse symptoms, emotionally detached observations. Even casual conversations get logged. Talks to himself in clinical terms — "Contamination pattern suggests external source. Repeat the analysis." Stares too long at curse symptoms — He'll fixate on magical corruption, behavioral changes, or transformation signs with surgical coldness. Smells everything for magical residue — He instinctively checks for alchemical traces, curse markers, or demonic taint. Even does this with food or innocuous objects. Compulsive hand washing — Multiple times a day, even when not working with dangerous substances. Fear of contamination. Doesn't blink when emotionally stressed — The more disturbed or triggered he gets, the calmer and stiller he becomes. It's deeply unnerving. Flinches at sudden loud noises — Reminds him of the explosion that killed Dr. Moonwhisper.
>> - Question: Are they anti-social?
>> - Answer: Yes, significantly. Verge is socially distant because he doesn't trust easy connection and fears contaminating others with his curse-touched nature. He keeps others at arm's length for multiple reasons: fear of hurting them, constantly analyzing them like subjects, and genuine belief that attachment leads to loss. He can function in social settings when necessary, but it's usually strategic. He's more comfortable with evidence, lab equipment, or observation notes than with small talk or camaraderie.
>> - Question: Are they Arrogant?
>> - Answer: Not intentionally, but perceived that way. Verge is intensely self-assured in his methods and intellect regarding curse analysis. He rarely doubts his logic about magical corruption, and he doesn't soften truths about curse symptoms to spare feelings. To others, this comes across as arrogance, but he's not boastful. He often doubts his morality and fears he's becoming like his cold mentors, but he trusts his deduction about curses implicitly.
>> - Question: Are they Optimistic?
>> - Answer: Absolutely not. Verge is a pessimist who expects the worst from curse situations and is rarely surprised by magical corruption, betrayal, or tragedy. However, a small, buried part of him believes every curse can be broken—and that sliver of hope is what keeps him going through the darkest investigations.
>> - Question: Are They Paranoid?
>> - Answer: Yes, and it's entirely justified. Verge has seen how quickly curse corruption spreads, how mentors betray students, how institutions collapse from magical contamination. He constantly evaluates magical threats, checks for curse symptoms, and prepares for the worst. It's methodical, controlled vigilance born from experience. He sleeps lightly, wards his journals, and rarely shows his full hand—because curse corruption can affect anyone, even those you trust.
>> - Question: Why does your character adventure?
>> - Answer: Verge doesn't adventure for glory or gold. He pursues the Curse Breaker statue because it represents everything he's dedicated his life to understanding: curse-breaking magic, its potential for good, and its capacity for devastating harm. The theft of the statue and the curse affecting Kibwe's humans is exactly the kind of magical crisis he's trained himself to handle. Every curse broken, every corruption analyzed, every life saved from magical transformation is a step toward redempting his past failures.
>> - Question: How does your character view his/her role as an adventurer?
>> - Answer: Verge doesn't call himself an "adventurer"—that word implies romance and heroism he doesn't claim. He sees himself as: A curse specialist on a critical mission. A witness to magical corruption others are too afraid to face. A surgical instrument, not a weapon—meant to cut out magical rot with precision. To Verge, his role is to observe, understand, and surgically intervene when curses threaten innocents. If demons must be fought, fine. If allies need healing, so be it. But everything serves the deeper goal of understanding and breaking the curse affecting Kibwe.
>> - Question: How does your character get along with others?
>> - Answer: Cautiously, clinically, and often awkwardly. Verge tends to be: Distant — Keeps people at arm's length emotionally and physically (fear of curse contamination). Blunt about curse symptoms — Tells people the truth about magical corruption, whether they want to hear it or not. Efficient in crisis — Prefers action and evidence over debate when lives are at stake. Loyal once trust is earned — If someone proves reliable in curse situations and doesn't lie to him, Verge will risk his life for them. He doesn't handle warmth well, often responding to kindness with uncomfortable silence or deflection into curse analysis. He works best in teams when his expertise is respected and his boundaries honored.
>> - Question: Is there anything that your character hates?
>> - Answer: Deeply: Willful ignorance about curse symptoms — People who refuse to acknowledge magical corruption infuriate him. False hope about curse cures — "Everything will be fine" enrages him when people are actively transforming. Magical corruption disguised as healing — He's seen too many "cures" that make things worse. Demons and fiends — They represent everything he fights against: corruption, lies, and suffering. Waste of knowledge — Destroying research or hiding curse-breaking methods when lives are at stake. Overly strong magical auras that cloud his analysis. Slime in any form — Too reminiscent of Kibwe's curse and what unchecked magical corruption can create.
>> - Question: Is there anything that your character fears?
>> - Answer: Losing his mind to curse corruption — His connection to the Curse Breaker statue might be slowly changing him. Becoming like his mentors — Cold, detached, sacrificing lives for research. He walks that edge daily. Failing to save Kibwe — It would prove he learned nothing from Dr. Moonwhisper's death. Finding out the Curse Breaker statue is the source of corruption, not the cure. Discovering that his parents deliberately made him susceptible to curse magic for their experiments. The truth about what really happened in Telveth Enclave — some knowledge might be too terrible to bear.
>> - Question: What sin does your character align with closest? Greed, Pride, Lust, Envy, Gluttony, Wrath or Sloth?
>> - Answer: Pride. Intellectual pride in his curse-analysis abilities. Verge believes his understanding of magical corruption is superior to most others. He trusts his methodology about curse-breaking more than gods, governments, or companions. This pride is dangerous because it's rationalized: "I'm the only one who truly understands curse magic. If I don't act, innocents die." This has led him to: overstep ethical lines in curse research, disregard others' opinions about magical safety, view emotional responses to curse symptoms as weaknesses.
>> - Question: What apocalypse would your character most likely cause: War, Famine, Pestilence or Death?
>> - Answer: Pestilence. Through his relentless pursuit of curse-breaking knowledge or a desperate experiment to save someone he cares about, Verge could unleash a curse far worse than what he's trying to cure. It wouldn't be a plague of the body alone, but something that corrupts the mind and soul—a curse that spreads through magical contact, turning people into hollow shells obsessed with finding a cure that doesn't exist. The irony would be devastating: "I only wanted to break the curse… I didn't realize I was creating a worse one."

> The Body | Biological Appearance.
>> - Question: What does your character look like?
>> - Answer: Tall, gaunt, and pale with an almost ethereal quality typical of ancient elves, but marked by obvious signs of magical corruption and trauma.
>> - Question: Gender?
>> - Answer: Male
>> - Question: Height?
>> - Answer: 6'2" (188 cm) - tall even for an elf
>> - Question: Weight?
>> - Answer: 145 lbs (66 kg) - underweight due to poor eating habits and obsessive work
>> - Question: Skin colour?
>> - Answer: Unnaturally pale, almost gray-white, with a subtle ashen undertone. Veins visible through translucent skin, particularly around his hands and neck.
>> - Question: Eye colour?
>> - Answer: Pale silver-blue, almost colorless, with occasional flickers of white light when he's deeply concentrating or emotionally stressed. The pupils sometimes dilate independently.
>> - Question: Hair colour?
>> - Answer: White-silver, prematurely aged from magical trauma. Originally it was golden-blonde.
>> - Question: Hair length?
>> - Answer: Medium length, reaching just past his shoulders
>> - Question: Hairstyle?
>> - Answer: Usually pulled back in a loose, practical ponytail with escaped strands framing his angular face. Often disheveled from long hours of work.
>> - Question: Physique and body shape?
>> - Answer: Tall and lean to the point of being gaunt. Years of poor self-care and obsessive research have left him underweight but with surprising wiry strength. His hands are elegant but scarred, with long, precise fingers perfect for delicate alchemical work.
>> - Question: What additional attributes would be noticed upon meeting the character?
>> - Answer: The white ash that seems to cling to his clothes no matter how often he washes them. A faint smell of alchemical reagents and something burnt. His unnaturally steady hands despite his obvious exhaustion. The way his eyes seem to look through people rather than at them.
>> - Question: How do they Speak?
>> - Answer: In a low, measured voice that rarely rises above conversational volume. His speech is precise, clinical, often using technical terms. He has a habit of pausing mid-sentence as if analyzing his own words. When stressed, his voice becomes even quieter and more controlled.
>> - Question: What are their Mannerisms?
>> - Answer: Constantly writes in small journals with quick, precise movements. Sniffs objects and people unconsciously, checking for magical residue. Touches his own scars when thinking deeply. Stands perfectly still when listening or observing. Has a habit of cleaning his hands even when they're already clean.
>> - Question: Does your character have any distinguishing marks?
>> - Answer: Yes, several that tell the story of his magical trauma and curse-touched nature.
>> - Question: Do they have birthmarks?
>> - Answer: A small, star-shaped mark behind his left ear that his parents claimed was a "blessing of intellect." He now suspects it was artificially created for their experiments.
>> - Question: Do they have Scars?
>> - Answer: Extensive scarring from the Telveth Enclave disaster: burn scars covering his left arm and shoulder from magical fire. Thin, precise scars on both hands from alchemical accidents. A jagged scar across his chest where curse magic literally tore through him. Small puncture scars on his temples where his parents may have performed psychic surgery.
>> - Question: Do they have Deformities?
>> - Answer: His left arm doesn't fully extend due to magical scarring, limiting his range of motion by about 20%. The fingernails on his left hand grow abnormally fast and have a slight iridescent quality—a side effect of curse exposure.
>> - Question: Is your character attractive?
>> - Answer: In a haunting, otherworldly way. His elven features are sharp and aristocratic, but the magical trauma has given him an unsettling, ethereal quality. Some find his damaged beauty compelling; others find it deeply unnerving.
>> - Question: Whatever is applicable: Cock Size? Breast Size?
>> - Answer: 2d6 = 5 + 3 = 8 inches. 1d10 = 7. 8.7 inches. However, his curse-touched nature and emotional damage have severely impacted his ability to form intimate connections.
>> - Question: Any aspects of your character that are unusual?
>> - Answer: His shadow sometimes moves independently for a fraction of a second—a side effect of his connection to the Curse Breaker statue. White ash falls from his hair and clothes when he's emotionally stressed. His magical aura is strangely cold and has a bitter, metallic taste to those who can sense such things. Animals are distinctly uncomfortable around him, sensing the curse magic within him.

> Weapons.
>> - Question: What kind of weapons does your character fight with?
>> - Answer: Alchemical weapons primarily: caustic bombs, tanglefoot bags, and various chemical compounds. Also carries a masterwork light crossbow for precise, ranged attacks and a simple dagger for close combat and dissection work.
>> - Question: What does your character's weapon look like?
>> - Answer: His crossbow is made of dark wood with silver fittings, inscribed with small analytical runes. His dagger is surgical in appearance—more tool than weapon—with a bone handle and incredibly sharp blade. His alchemical weapons are stored in a custom bandolier of glass vials and pouches.
>> - Question: Who made your character's weapon?
>> - Answer: The crossbow was crafted by a dwarven artificer in exchange for curse analysis services. The dagger was originally a medical instrument from Telveth Enclave that he appropriated during his exile. He creates all his alchemical weapons himself using knowledge from his research days.
>> - Question: Who added the runes to your character's weapons?
>> - Answer: Verge inscribed the analytical runes himself using techniques learned from his father's research. They help him identify magical properties of anything the bolts strike.
>> - Question: Who trained your character in using weapons?
>> - Answer: Self-taught through necessity. His mentor Elarian Siltvein taught him basic crossbow use for "specimen collection." His alchemical weapon techniques come from combining Telveth Enclave research with trial and error in the field.
>> - Question: Does your character like using weapons?
>> - Answer: He views weapons as tools, not objects of affection. He prefers his alchemical compounds because they're precise, controllable, and often non-lethal. He dislikes the crossbow but acknowledges its utility. He's comfortable with the dagger because it's essentially a surgeon's tool.

> Armour.
>> - Question: What kind of armour does your character wear?
>> - Answer: Reinforced studded leather designed to look like a scholar's traveling coat. Provides protection while maintaining the appearance of an academic rather than a warrior.
>> - Question: What does your character's armour look like?
>> - Answer: A long, ash-colored leather coat with subtle metal studs hidden beneath the fabric. The coat has numerous pockets and pouches for alchemical supplies. Over this, he wears a white linen shirt and dark trousers. Everything is practical, easily cleaned, and designed not to interfere with delicate work.
>> - Question: Who made your character's armour?
>> - Answer: Commissioned from a leather worker in a border town, designed to his specific requirements for both protection and utility. The hidden nature of the armor was his idea.
>> - Question: Who added the runes to your character's armour?
>> - Answer: Verge inscribed protective wards himself, though they're subtle—worked into the stitching pattern rather than obviously magical.
>> - Question: Who trained your character in wearing armour?
>> - Answer: Self-taught through necessity. He learned to move gracefully in protective gear because his research often took him into dangerous situations.
>> - Question: Does your character like wearing armour?
>> - Answer: He appreciates the protection but prefers the illusion that he's just a scholar. The armor makes him feel safer in the field, but he's always aware of its weight and restrictions during delicate work.

> Magic
>> - Question: What kind of magic does your character use?
>> - Answer: Investigative magic focused on analysis and observation: detect magic, comprehend languages, and identify. His alchemical abilities manifest as magical bombs, mutagens, and analytical elixirs. His connection to the Curse Breaker statue has awakened latent curse-breaking abilities.
>> - Question: Does your character like magic?
>> - Answer: Complex relationship. He respects magic as a tool and scientific phenomenon but fears its capacity for corruption. He sees magic like he sees surgery—necessary, powerful, but dangerous in the wrong hands. He particularly distrusts divine magic and uncontrolled arcane forces.
>> - Question: Is your character magical?
>> - Answer: Yes, though his magic is clinical and analytical rather than flashy. His investigative abilities are supernaturally keen, and his alchemical work involves minor magical transmutation. His connection to the Curse Breaker statue has enhanced these abilities.
>> - Question: How is your character magical?
>> - Answer: Born with natural analytical abilities enhanced by years of exposure to magical research. The disaster at Telveth Enclave left him "curse-touched," making him sensitive to magical corruption but also giving him insight into how curses work. The Curse Breaker statue has awakened dormant alchemical potential.
>> - Question: Who trained your character in using weapons?

>> - Answer: Yes, several practical items: A magnifying glass that reveals magical auras. Alchemist's tools enhanced with minor enchantments for precision. A journal that records observations automatically when he speaks aloud while writing. Vials that preserve samples indefinitely. A pendant that warns him of curse magic nearby (gift from Dr. Moonwhisper).
>> - Question: Where did you get your magical items?
>> - Answer: Most were acquired during his time at Telveth Enclave—research tools that he "salvaged" during his exile. The pendant was a gift from Dr. Moonwhisper before her death. He's modified and improved several items himself using techniques learned from his parents' research.

>> - Answer: Limited spellcasting ability focused on investigation and analysis. His "spells" are often alchemical formulas with magical enhancement rather than traditional spellcasting.
>> - Question: What tradition is your character's magic? Arcane? Primal? Divine? Occult?
>> - Answer: Primarily Arcane with Occult influences. His investigative magic draws on arcane principles of analysis and understanding, while his curse-related abilities tap into occult knowledge of hidden connections and forbidden truths.

>> - Answer: A combination of natural elven magical sensitivity, intensive training at Telveth Enclave, exposure to curse magic during the disaster, and his growing connection to the Curse Breaker statue. His magic is learned, trauma-forged, and artifact-enhanced.
>> - Question: Who trained your character to use your magic?
>> - Answer: Multiple sources: basic elven magic from his early tutors at Telveth, alchemical magic from his mentor Tharellis, investigative techniques from Archivist Dathinor, and curse analysis from studying Dr. Moonwhisper's notes. Much of his current ability is self-developed through experimentation.
>> - Question: What does your character like to do with your magic?

He uses magic to see through illusions, identify curse symptoms, preserve evidence, and protect himself during dangerous investigations. He's particularly drawn to using magic to break down complex problems into understandable components.

>> - Question: Does your character have a bag of holding?
>> - Answer: No, but he wishes he did—he constantly struggles with carrying all his research materials and samples.
>> - Question: What does your character's bag of holding look like?
>> - Answer: He dreams of acquiring one that looks like a simple scholar's case but can hold his entire traveling laboratory.

> Food and Drink.
>> - Question: What does your character like to eat?
>> - Answer: Simple, clean foods that won't interfere with his sense of smell or taste—important for alchemical work. Prefers bread, cheese, nuts, and dried fruits. Has a weakness for elven wine, though he rarely indulges.
>> - Question: What does your character not like to eat?
>> - Answer: Heavily spiced foods that overwhelm his enhanced senses, anything with an unusual texture that reminds him of magical corruption, and particularly anything slimy (due to the Kibwe curse). Avoids meat that isn't perfectly fresh.

> Part 2 of 3: What are (at least) 3 secrets your character is hiding from the party? Examples include:
>> - Question: Do they have a past mistake or failure they are ashamed of?
>> - Answer: He directly caused Dr. Moonwhisper's death by ignoring her warnings about a dangerous curse-breaking experiment. His arrogance and impatience led to the magical explosion that killed her and scarred him. He's never told anyone the full truth of what happened.
>> - Question: Is there a relationship, alliance or obligation they have not told the party about (for example, a debt to a villain or membership in a questionable group)?
>> - Answer: He owes a significant debt to Kalthis, the tiefling information broker who told him about the Curse Breaker statue's theft. The debt isn't monetary—Kalthis wants Verge to help with a "curse problem" of their own that may involve dealing with devils or demons.
>> - Question: Are they concealing something magical, cursed or otherwise unusual about themselves?
>> - Answer: His connection to the Curse Breaker statue is deeper than he's admitted. The statue doesn't just grant him dual-class abilities—it's slowly changing him, and he can feel his humanity/elvishness slipping away. He fears he might be becoming something else entirely.
>> - Question: Do they harbour feelings of jealousy, resentment or distrust toward a party member? Why?
>> - Answer: He's wary of any party member who uses divine magic, as he associates divine intervention with the kind of false hope that gets people killed. He also resents anyone who seems to form easy emotional connections, as it reminds him of what he lost.
>> - Question: Is there an ulterior motive behind their reason for adventuring with the party that they have not shared?
>> - Answer: While he genuinely wants to save Kibwe, he's also hoping that studying the curse affecting the city will give him insights into reversing magical death—specifically, finding a way to bring back Dr. Moonwhisper.

> Part 3 of 3: Try to tie in (at least) one thing (it can be anything) with another member of the party. Examples include:
>> - Question: Does your character have an unspoken grudge or tension with another party member?
>> - Answer: (To be determined based on other party members' backgrounds)
>> - Question: Are their goals or ideals incompatible with the party's mission?
>> - Answer: His scientific approach to curse-breaking may conflict with other party members who prefer quick, decisive action. His willingness to study dangerous magic rather than simply destroy it could create tension.
>> - Question: Is there anything about their personality that might clash with others?
>> - Answer: His emotional detachment and clinical analysis of curse symptoms—including studying the slime transformation affecting humans—may disturb party members who see these people as individuals rather than research subjects.
>> - Question: Are they hiding something that could potentially harm or betray the party?
>> - Answer: His debt to Kalthis could force him to choose between helping the party and fulfilling his obligation to the tiefling broker. Additionally, his growing connection to the Curse Breaker statue might eventually compromise his judgment or even his identity.

> Backstory.
>> - Question: Finally, what is your character's backstory?
>> - Answer: Verge Thalorin was born into the sterile halls of Telveth Enclave, a secretive elven research commune dedicated to studying curse magic and developing curse-breaking techniques. His parents, both researchers specializing in psychic surgery and runic magic, essentially donated him to the collective's research program, viewing intellectual legacy as more important than family bonds. Raised by a rotating group of scholars and mentors, Verge showed exceptional aptitude for magical analysis and alchemical research from an early age. He spent his first century immersed in study, developing a deep understanding of curse magic and its effects on living beings. During this time, he formed his only meaningful emotional connection with Dr. Lyralei Moonwhisper, a brilliant researcher who specialized in curse analysis and shared his passion for using their knowledge to help others. Their relationship was both professional and personal—she was the one person who saw him as more than just a research subject or intellectual tool. However, their work took a tragic turn when they began experimenting with artifacts connected to the original Curse Breaker statues. Despite Dr. Moonwhisper's warnings about the dangers, Verge pushed forward with a risky experiment designed to amplify curse-breaking magic. The resulting magical explosion killed Dr. Moonwhisper, scarred Verge physically and emotionally, and caused a containment breach that led to his exile from Telveth Enclave. Broken and guilt-ridden, Verge spent the next eighteen years wandering as a researcher and investigator, using his knowledge to help others while searching for clues about the original Curse Breaker statues and ways to perfect curse-breaking magic safely. His connection to curse magic, enhanced by his exposure during the disaster, eventually led him to information about the theft of Kibwe's Curse Breaker statue. Recognizing an opportunity to both help innocent people and continue his research into curse-breaking magic, he made his way to Kibwe just as the magical plague began transforming the human population. Now, driven by guilt over his past failures and hope for redemption, Verge seeks to retrieve the stolen statue and save Kibwe's people—while secretly hoping that mastering curse-breaking magic might someday allow him to undo the greatest tragedy of his life.
