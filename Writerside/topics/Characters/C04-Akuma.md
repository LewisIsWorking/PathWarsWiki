# C04-Akuma

Akuma is a Human Hungerseed from Tian Xia. 

If his appearance was not enough of an ill omen, the death of his mother solidified it. 

He does not remember too much of his childhood and only knows of his mother's fate from the priestess who took care of him. 

Ba-Ming was a traveller who tried to spread the teachings of Shizuru to the lands across the seas. 

She was the only one to call him by his actual name, Zheng.

Aside from the teachings of the goddess, Ba-Ming taught him about honour and how to protect those you love and care for.
Sadly, she passed away from illness on the boat to Magnimar. 

Akuma had just turned 12 at that time. 

From there, he continued to preach of Shizuru, the only way he could show his gratitude for his deceased mentor.

He was lucky to not have to resort to thievery to survive as another horned individual took him in. 

This one's skin was a deep shade of violet, and his horns curled like a ram's. 

He only introduced himself as Kavaar and put Akuma to work almost immediately. 

Kavaar was a hard man, and he did not talk much outside to give an order, but he never struck or belittled Akuma.

Yet Magnimar proved to be a troubled city rife with crime and violence. 

More often than not, Akuma found himself in a scuffle or scrap to try to help a victim of robbery or other disorderly conduct. 

As long as he performed his work, Kavaar did not seem to mind.

Under Kavaar's care, Akuma grew to be strong. 

With Ba-Ming's influence, he also grew to have a sense of justice about him. 

He thanked Kavaar profusely, but he knew that he could do more by joining the guard than he could through vigilantism. 

Kavaar tossed a Katana at him, Akuma remembered selling it shortly after arriving as he was sure Ba-Ming would understand his need for some food and shelter. 

Akuma nearly fell to his knees in awe, 
but Kavaar simply waved him away as if he were a nuisance, but Akuma caught the smallest glimpse of a smile, signifying his approval.

He now has a towering 6'10 (2 M) frame, carrying a mass that is surprisingly hefty. In fact, weighing over 220 pounds (ca. 100 kg) of weight. 

His eyes are black as midnight aside from two rings of purple that seem to glow in the dark complements his orangish skin with a set of large protruding horns pointing upwards towards the heavens. 

Two small tusks poke out from his lower jaw.

When Akuma joined the guard, he was almost certain it was due to his intimidating appearance, but he was sure that his skill would shine through, given time.
