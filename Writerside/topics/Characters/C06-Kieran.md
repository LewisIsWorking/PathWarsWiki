# C06-Kieran

Okay, this is my "rough draft" to help you keep the game moving:

> Backstory:
>> - Kieran did not have any parents as a child. 
>> - Not biological, in any case. 
>> - He was raised in a small village surrounded by a forest that had a curse placed upon it. 
>> - No adults lived in this village, only children, and those children never aged due to this curse. 
>> - These children were often "found" in the forest, lost, their parents disfigured into horrible-looking monsters. 
>> - The village's guardian was a Treant that requested to be called "Tree". 
>> - Tree was by far the oldest individual in the village, and it did its best to care for these lost children. 
>> - Like most children, Kieran quickly forgot their parents and moved on to enjoy the life that Tree provided for them. 
>> - They were well-fed, had cosy beds, and got to play most of the day. 
>> - Once you hit a certain age, Tree would assign a guardian elemental to you, which was considered a great honour. 
>> - That never did happen for Kieran. 
>> - He was never given this guardian. 
>> - One day, Navilar, one of the better-known guardian elementals, approached Kieran and was asked to see Tree immediately. 
>> - At first, Kieran was excited. 
>> - Had the time to receive his guardian finally come? 
>> - When he approached the Tree, something was immediately off. 
>> - Tree's leaves, which used to be so vibrant and green with life, were withered and falling away. 
>> - His bark had taken on a pallid tone. 
>> - Tree told Kieran that he was being destroyed by a new curse. 
>> - One that originated from outside the village. 
>> - He then told him that, unlike the other children, he was not found in the forest. 
>> - But instead, he was brought here by his mother before she passed. 
>> - She also passed along a prophecy to Tree. 
>> - A prophecy in which Kieran would save the world. 
>> - With his last breaths, Tree told Kieran what he could, assigned Navilar as his guardian elemental, and told him to leave the village and the forest. 
>> - Told him to become the hero he was meant to be. 
>> - At first, he was not sure if he could go. 
>> - There were so many other children who now had no Tree to protect them. 
>> - But Serena, his best friend in the village, promised she could take care of them. 
>> - She was always mature and would probably have been considered a mother figure if age were not a factor. 
>> - Kieran did leave and has been seeking the source of the curse plaguing his home. 
>> - He has encountered many terrible creatures in his travels and has learned even more ways to defeat them. 
>> - He has even gathered a few powerful relics along the way.
>> - Recently, he has heard of a curse affecting the city of Kibwe. 
>> - Even though he doubts the curse is from the same source that plagues his village, he hopes it will provide valuable clues and insight that could help.
