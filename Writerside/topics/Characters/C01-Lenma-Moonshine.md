>> - Is there a relationship, alliance or obligation they have not told the party about? This one sounds fun, and I think it would make sense for her to have some sort of debt due to her recklessness.
>> - Are they concealing something magical, cursed or otherwise unusual about themselves? I really feel like I cannot answer these yet because it needs to be discovered in play.
>> - Do they harbour feelings of jealousy, resentment or distrust toward a party member? Why? (Not specified)
>> - Is there an ulterior motive behind their reason for adventuring with the party that they have not shared? I really feel like I cannot answer these yet because it needs to be discovered in play.
