   Plot hooks.
   Part 1 of 3: What are (at least) 5 accomplishments your character wishes to achieve? Examples include:
   ● What is a personal milestone your character dreams of reaching (for example, mastering a skill, unlocking a power or finding their calling)?
   ○ Sail around the world and collect items of sentiment from every location
   ■ Sub-goal: owning her own ship and captaining a crew
   ● Does your character have a relationship they want to build or repair (for example, with a family member, a mentor or even an estranged enemy)?
   ○ I think there could be, but I’d wanna discuss any NPCs with you
   ● Is there a location they have always wanted to visit or conquer? Why?
   ○ Tian Xia seems like such a faraway mystery to her, and she wants to see what it’s like halfway across Golarion

● Does your character have an ideal legacy they wish to leave behind?
● What is one immediate, achievable goal they are pursuing right now?
○ Getting back on her feet and finding another opportunity for coin
● Is there a wrong they feel compelled to make right, either for themselves or someone else?
● What is a selfish desire they may not admit to others but secretly want to fulfill?
○ Get rich lmao
Part 2 of 3: What are (at least) 3 secrets your character is hiding from the party? Examples include:
● Do they have a past mistake or failure they are ashamed of?
● Is there a relationship, alliance or obligation they have not told the party about (for example, a debt to a villain or membership in a questionable group)?
○ This one sounds fun, and I think it’d make sense for her to have some sort of debt due to her recklessness
● Are they concealing something magical, cursed or otherwise unusual about themselves?
● Do they harbour feelings of jealousy, resentment or distrust toward a party member? Why?
● Is there an ulterior motive behind their reason for adventuring with the party that they have not shared?
○ I really feel like I can’t answer these yet cause it needs to be discovered in play
Part 3 of 3: Try to tie in (at least) one thing (it can be anything) with another member of the party. Examples include:
● Does your character have an unspoken grudge or tension with another party member?
● Are their goals or ideals incompatible with the party's mission?
● Is there anything about their personality that might clash with others?
○ I don’t know anything about the existing party, but her carelessness is can certainly be a burden
● Are they hiding something that could potentially harm or betray the party?
Backstory.
Finally, what is your character's backstory?
Backstory by each Year.
Now find out the current campaign's current in-game year. For Doomsday Funtime it is currently 4710 AR. If your character is 25 years old, then your character was born in 4685 AR.
Take each year, put a colon and write what the character did that year, starting with their birth year. In the above example, it would go like this: 4685 AR, age 0: Born to my parents in Deep-Water. 4686 AR, age 1: The dragon attack on Deep-Water, parents are dead. ... (You would fill this in). 4705 AR, age 20: Achieved first level in rogue. 4708 AR, age 23: Joined the party.
If you have any other questions about this, please contact me on my telegram.
AR 4669, age 0: born
AR 4670, age 1: running around and learning to hunt
AR 4675, age 6: basic literacy and accounting skills
AR 4679, age 10: basic survival skills and first taste of alcohol
AR 4685, age 16: coming of age ceremony, embarks on journey through the inner seas region
AR 4686, age 17: arrives at Riddleport and starts learning to sail
AR 4687, age 18: hired onto first crew, achieved Level 1
AR 4688, age 19: fired and kicked out of crew, worked on several crews after, Level 2
AR 4689, age 20: unemployed with a reputation in Riddleport for being a drunken klutz surviving on sheer luck, looking for opportunities to earn more money and get back on her feet
Beyond the first level.
1. Are you higher than level 1? What level?
   a. Riddleport campaign is currently level 2
2. What year did your character achieve first level in their class?
   a. Age 18
3. How long has it been chronological since your character was first level?
   a. Two years of bumbling around from ship to ship
4. What has your character been doing since they started adventuring (aka first level)?
   a. Trying to earn coin by working as a crew member on ships in Riddleport
5. How did you achieve each level? Aka what did you kill to level up?
   a. Does level up require a “kill?” Seems like a bit of an old fashioned RPG idea
   i. Experience is probably defending cargo ships from pirates before getting thrown out of the crew for being too much of a drunk again
6. How long did each level take to achieve?
   a. Took 2 years of traveling through Varisia by foot to go from trained apprentice at level 0 when leaving home to getting level 1 by arrival in Riddleport
   Time since level 1.
   This is a continuation of the 'Backstory by each year' section for if you are starting after the first level. This section involves writing what your character has been doing since level 1, aka since their backstory.
   To do this, you can decide at what age the character became level 1, and what age they are now. Example: Level 1 at age 20, level 10 at age 25. This example would put the character at a progression rate of 6 months to 1 level. For a human this is pretty normal, but for an elf you may space levels out over decades, longer for some other races.

Assuming level 1 at age 20, that means they came level 1 in 4705 AR. Now we expand out your 'backstory by each year' section but including 'level x' after the age of our character before the colon.
Level 0 at age 16 when embarking on the world.
Level 1 at 18.
Level 2 at 19.
Currently still level 2 after turning 20.
