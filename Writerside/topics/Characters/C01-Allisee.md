## Backstory:


Alissee was born as the daughter of Yubis Dara. But she has no memory of her time with her mother as she abbandonned/trusted her to her father Treluf Tra-Umna, a human taldorian noble.
Some time after that her Father married a human noblewoman Elonia and had a daughter which was designated as heir and the half sister of Alissee Lylissee.
The two half-sisters were allowed to be and play together during their childhood even if Alissee wasn’t a legitimate child
mostly thanks to the intervention of the grandfather of the family who pushed his son to own up to his mistakes and take responsability.
During her childhood, Alissee often looked up to the night sky, she was already fascinated by the beauty of the moon and stars at this time
and spent a lot of nights stargazing. Her sister joined in at some point and before they knew it they were stargazing together every night.
When came the day of her sister’s 14th birthday (25/04) and after the birthday party, the two sisters once again went stargazing this night,
this time however there were no stars in the sky and no moon either. Lylissee decided to look around instead since there was nothing to see in the sky.
She got intrigued by an animal she caught a glimpse off, she ran off into a forest and Alissee ran after her.
They followed this animal quite a while and got deep into the forest.
They found a small hut where the animal had entered, when they entered it turned out they interrupted a hag’s coven gathering.
The hag captured them both but it seems they weren't interested in Alissee,
they left Alissee to die after torturing her and blasting off the left side of her head with magic.
She was found by a search party sent by her father, she was miraculously alive and in one piece although she had a sort of scar or burn marks left by the magic,
and a glowing silver eye that replaced her missing one. She has very little memory of this event but still remembers her sister being taken away.
After this day, things changed, she was blamed for what happened (being the older sister) and even if she wasn’t physically abused,
she was put under a lot of mental stress... Which ultimately led her to forming a pact with a mysterious shadowy entity.
Realising that something was up(maybe), her father sent her to the Eastern front Academy to study magic.
