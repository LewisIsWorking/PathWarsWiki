>> - Answer: 4643 AR: Born, one of three children born to Noz and Chit of the Drumish Dasher. 4644 - 4645 AR : Quiet and simple as his warren traveled the lands, too young to have done much of interest. 4646 AR : Started running small errands, moving supplies between various booths and the wagons. 4647 AR : A plague struck the warren, approximately one third of the warren died and he barely survived. 4648 AR : Quiet, trying to recover from the devastating losses of the previous year. 4649 AR : Joined with a smaller warren who suffered a similar fate the previous year. Expanded trade across the sea with Drumish Dashers of Andoran and Taldor. Began his education in the small school within the warren's wagons. 4650 AR: Started showing signs of his Nephilim ancestry as small protrusions started peeking out from his short fur on his head. Began assisting with fetching supplies for the warren alchemists exclusively, preparing for an eventual apprenticeship when he got older. 4651 AR : Showing a knack for book learning he starts getting extra tutor sessions outside of his normal lessons. 4652 AR : Started his apprenticeship under Knagi, one of the warren's alchemists. 4653 AR : His warren was attacked by raiders as they traveled through the desert on their way to El-Fatar in Katapesh. The warren's defenders managed to drive them off, but there were many casualties. When they reached El-Fatar they hired an adventuring party to root out the raiders which the party succeeded in doing. 4654 AR : Still recovering from the raid the warren started hiring bodyguards to supplement their defenders. 4655 AR : Having reached adulthood Rax begins to receive some measure of combat training as part of his studies. 4656 AR : Rax falls in love for the first time. With a young Tengu bodyguard that was traveling with them on the long journey from Katapesh (city) to Lamasara in Thuvia. 4657 AR : The Tengu bodyguard (Puck) stays on with the warren as they board a vessel to cross the Inner Sea to Augustana in Andoran but departs once they arrive in the port city. Negotiations begin to join a larger warren as his warren never fully recovered after the raid four years prior. 4658 AR : Negotiations conclude shortly after the new year with his warren joining the larger warren. Rax begins a relationship with his teacher's daughter though it is short-lived. 4659 AR : While on a supply run with a small number of the warren, Rax is ambushed by a group of Cult of the Dawnflower acolytes. The timely arrival of the town guard and a doctor was the only thing that saved his life. Said doctor, a human by the name of Khonsu, was a clockwork researcher and replaced Rax's destroyed right arm and right eye with clockwork replacements. As Rax needed time to recover and to learn how to use and maintain his new clockwork parts he was left in the care of the doctor until the warren passed close again. During the time he spent with Khonsu, Rax also learned of the Laws of Mortality which Khonsu followed in his daily life and in how he treated his patients. Rax also learned much more in the field of medicine and how to integrate his own alchemical knowledge with it. 4660 AR : Rax remained in the care and tutelage of Khonsu for half the year. By the time his warren retrieved him Rax had fully embraced the Laws of Mortality and decided he was going to follow in Khonsu's footsteps and become a healer. Once returned to the warren he started focusing his studies on such pursuits. 4661 AR : Rax finishes his apprenticeship under Knagi despite tensions building between apprentice and master due to his new beliefs and focused study. Rax had a short, intimate relationship with Halfling twins (Aldus and Rossa) that ended when Rossa had a pregnancy scare that revealed she had been cheating on him.
