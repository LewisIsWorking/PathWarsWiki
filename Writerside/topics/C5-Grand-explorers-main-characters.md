### Backstory
Aekold Black-steel was born in Haldun to Ilda Greyrite and Voltak Blacksteel, his mother (Ilda Greyrite a healer in Haldun) married into the Blacksteel family, 
which has for nearly every generation joined Rahadoums military.

He grew up hearing stories from his father of the "great" acts his father performed and was inspired by them to become a great and admirable person.

However, at 9, his father died on a hunting trip leaving his mother to raise him. 
Since his father was no longer around, he wanted to look for someone who could help teach him how to fight so he could be like his great father one day.

Only a few months later, Aekold came across an old man his mother was healing known as Lostav Uddrul, an old soldier who was previously part of the Radahoum military.

Upon recognising that Aekold was the son of Voltak, an old friend of Lostavs, Lostav took it upon himself to train the eager Aekold in swordsmanship.

Unfortunately this training only lasted three years with Lostav becoming bedridden due to a sickness he caught at his old age and only a few months later Lostav had passed away.

Although somewhat irked at the inconvienience caused by this Aekold found himself more disappointed by the fact that he was no longer able to be trained by Lostav but still respected the man for his helping him.

For the next few months Aekold continued to train on his own. Two months before his eighteenth birthday he went to hunt some wild creatures on his own to prove to himself his training this year was worth it.

For the next month he had spent his time working from lower mountains near Haldun upwards hunting whatever creatures there with a hunting knife, a sword and padded leather to protect himself.

The first few weeks were merely that of hunting for food and getting used to the harsher air and rough terrain,

but someday on the third week he had found a cougar feasting upon a creature that Aekold could assume to be a rabid dog.

Thankfully due to the dimmer light of dusk and loud shrilling of the mountainous bug Aekold had managed to not catch the beasts attention,

taking advantage Aekold kept his distance to the beast and attempted to get behind it however the dim light had also been to Aekold disadvantage as he had slipped upon the lose dirt of the mountain and while he had caught himself from falling he had caught the beasts attention which had quickly begun rushing towards Aekold,

and with a quick reaction only from the many years of training and work,

Aekold had taken a great slash at the now jumping Cougar catching its neck and managing to bring it to the ground with the sheer weight and force behind the slash.

Managing to fully recover his footing Aekold could finally take in what had just happened and upon realizing he took great pride but however was unconsiously shaking from the fight and when he realized this he didnt think that it was caused from a fear of death but rather an exhileration that he again felt great joy in and had decided to butcher the beast there with his bloodied, shaking hands.

After managing to butcher the beast and severing its head he finally rested having finally ridden off the high the sky was dark with the moon barely providing a light to see anything in.

Given plenty of time to think of the events Aekold had finally understood what had just conspired, finally realizing his mortallity but rather than a fear of death he found a great purpose to become not only strong enough to deserve respect from others,

but respect from beasts and monsters finding no greater joy than the thought that he could one day stand as the highest in not only society but that of nature.

Returning back down the mountain with the head of the cougar and bloodied gear he hung the head of the cougar next to the many heads of beasts and monster that decorated the wall his father once used to mount trophies upon.

However with the new goal he had set he understood the weight and time required to get to that point but only wished to reach that point as soon as possible wasting no time in needless time fighting only beasts,

so upon his 18th birthday he left the village of Haldun and ventured north only wishing to traverse the mountains which he had only hoped could be used as a test for fighting humanoids such as dangerous renegades or bandits.

Unfortunately this was not a fruitful endover only leading to months of traversing the mountain with the same gear as before and no such thrill from killing the dangerous wildlife only hoping for a test against man which had time and time again fought against nature and still persisted.

After the many months of the more or less the same travel rarely even encountering a merchant Aekold had reached the other side of the vast mountain range however far more north than he had expected,

recognizing the capital of Radahoum, Azir, from the descriptions of his fathers stories and seeing the great river seperating the vast mountains Aekold had come to know these many months Aekold made his way down the mountains wishing to find a new way to fulfill what he believed was his new purpose those many months back.

The great capital of Radahoum was by no means a dissapoint not only far dwarfing his home of Haldun in population but the very structures seemed far more impressive a sight.

Soon coming across a merchant looking for a extra hands on his ship which would traval and sell whatever goods he had,

Aekold recognizing the possiblity to fight the seafaring pirates Aekold took the merchant up on his offer and as a sign to be trusted he sold the few pelts quality pelts he had managed to take with him during his trip and although he had not managed to occure as much funds as he had hoped he found himself in need of new equipement as his had far been past blunted and worn down.

Upon the merchant accepting the much needed help from Aekold he had let Aekold know of their departure coming in but a few days and that Aekold would also be assisting with the movement of the goods.

Finding no interest in carrying boxes he rather set his mind towards his new equipement finding himself a breastplate,
a greatsword, and had repaired his now more than worn down hunting knife. The following years were more of the same and even the few pirates that would attack the sailing merchant ships would be more than easily fended of,

even the first kill of a man gave Aekold no satisfaction rather making him angrier that man which he believed had triumphed over nature could be so weak and that the pirates were not much more than a nuisance to be dealt with.

Although finding little joy in the work Aekold found it a good way to at least occure funds and held hope that he might one day find another who could bring him a great fight worthy of shaking and instilling the fear the cougar had that day,

and mounting that mans head upon his fathers wall as the first mans head to be presented their. Aekold not being aware of the tabboo however thought it was something normal and not even worth mentioning.

Upon the third year Aekold and the merchant ship were attacked by yet more pirates however this was different as great ships had risen from the ocean,

clad in sea life and rotting wood the ships seemed in disrepair but still sailed alongside the merchant ship as if the old ships sails were not tattered and thier masts had not impaled the ship.

The merchant ship was soon fired upon as hundreds of gunshots and cannons had battered the merchant ship, and far worse the crew turning the deck red and staining the windows,

Aekold having been below deck for but not even given a few minutes, were quickly alerted by the chaos above but were only able to see a great ship out of cracks in the hull,

the very attacking ship having been littered with undead barely visible through the clouds of smoke from the gunpowder.

Aekold frustrated by the lack of his strength at that moment realising that any attempt to go above deck would lead to getting turn into the red mists that had now seeped through the battered and broken deck from above.

However hard Aekold had wished for the firing to stop it continued blasting through his ears with the onslaught missing him so far but it would eventually lead to an iron ball flying through his breastplate and lodging itself in his ribs,

the mere shock knocking out Aekold and leaving him lying upon that batter shipped which at this point was cracking from its inabilty to hold itself together,

with thunderous booms and cracks the merchant ship broke into many pieces with Aekold barely being left alive and unconscious upon the wreckage of the ship and the great undead ships unseen even upon the horizon however there was not a pair of eyes to recogonize a soul as there only existed Aekold floating upon the bloodied remanents of the ship.
