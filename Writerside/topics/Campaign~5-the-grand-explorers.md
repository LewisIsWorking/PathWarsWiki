# Campaign~5-The-Grand-Explorers

IRL start date = 5th April 2023.

The campaign started in 4707 AR.
After the 3-year time gap, the year is 4710 AR.

## What is the Grand Explorers Campaign?

The grand explorers are a group of adventures hired by the Adventuring Society of Absalom.

The goal of the grand adventurers is to complete missions around the Inner sea region and the world beyond.

Missions can vary from some dungeon delving, crime investigations,
mystery solving, bounty hunting, historical documentation, and so on

## When do the Grand Explorers Explore each week?

18:00.

Wednesdays.

Weekly.

~~The day that this campaign will run is not set yet.~~
~~The day of the week that the campaign runs will nearly definitely change over time and will likely move to either Thursday or Friday in the long term.~~
~~The reason that the day of the campaign will change over time is because the game master runs two other campaigns.~~
~~The other two campaigns run currently on Friday and Saturday nights each.~~
~~At the moment having Thursday as a gap day is a good time gap to allow for a break and for preparation of the following two days of sessions (Friday and Saturday).~~
~~This campaigns run day will change in the future when Crimson Throne finishes.~~
~~When Crimson Throne finishes then Friday night will be freed up.~~
~~At that point having The Grand Explorers move to Friday nights would be the best possible scenario.~~
~~If this doesn't suit the majority of the players then the campaign can instead move to Thursday nights.~~
~~This chance won't happen until 2023 which is really far away so this is all very subject to change.~~

## When does this take place in the Golarion timeline?

## Anaiel & Aekold Black-Steel's introduction.

The group stand with Finara in the alleyway of inner seven-arches.
The elven scholar's eyes perk up, her eyes glow slightly.
Finara says:
"Someone is approaching, someone special."

Around the corner, two people appear.
A man and a woman.

@Craig
Aethelhelm,
The boon of the blood altar that you received in Shimmer-ford starts to cloud the very edge of your vision.
A shimmering of crimson appears swirls in the corners of your eyes.

These two people Aethelhelm, the power in their blood, it matches your own.
They also have received a strange, esoteric blessing.

Highlighted through their outfits, you see the crimson light faintly illuminate the outline of tattoos.
After about 3 seconds of this enhanced vision, you feel starved, hungry for blood; the vision power dissipates.

The people approach.

The man looks to be in his mid-twenties.
On the man's shoulder is the same tattoo of the whale that Doctor Etward Ritalson has.
He is a human with a slight mix of another race, causing his face to look ever so slightly non-human.

This human is wearing a gambeson under a breastplate, leather gloves and boots,
medium-sized travelling backpack on the back with a bedroll attached.

The woman looks to be in her mid-thirties.
On the woman's wrist is the same tattoo of the whale that Doctor Etward Ritalson has.

This woman is a fetching, a human corrupted by the shadow realm.
However, something is different about her.
A light is carried on her shadowy pale skin, a clear sign of a celestial blessing: an angelic aasimar Nephilim.
Her hair is such a light blonde it borders on white, just as light and shadow conflict across the rest of her body.
She has a small build: about 165 centimetres in height.

The two of them approach the group.

## Session 13 = The Grand Exploration, part 1 + 22nd November 2023.

Mission 2 ended with every member of the grand explorer’s being effected (let’s say) by the Mosquito Witch,
deep within the lake of the mountain besides the town.

The party enters Seven arches.
This city used to cause elves to die of magical radiation.

## Play By Post = The Grand Exploration + Starting 15th January 2024. 

The party has found itself in the Long-cursed River Kingdom: Seven Arches.

The party is seeking out the ally of Dr Ritalson, elven scholar Fianara Caralestri.
The group has since entered the inner walls of the city,
and as the party approaches the inn-district, keen-eyed elven women approached the group.

Fianara's eyes glow with mystic power,
and she holds a finely crafted magical bow loosely by her side, ready for a fight.
Along her back are stacks upon stacks of books and several full-looking bags of holding.

"About an hour ago, one of the druidic stewards that I am…
Friends with… alerted me that I might have visitors headed my way."
The elven scholar eyes you all wearily.
"So, to what do I owe the pleasure of such a visit?"

- The city of seven-arches.
- The party meets Finara.
- The party make their way to the seven arches.

You cross the stone bridge. 
The druidic guards do not prevent your passage, though eye your group wearily.

You pass by a few outer buildings, workshops, guard rooms, toilets,
and before the group is a large round stone corridor.

ANY magically attuned characters will feel primal magical essence here.
Anyone else simply feels a heaviness in the air, a great pressure on the mind and body.

Streaks of light pierce the walls from above through the vines and cracked stone.

The group walks through the dark corridors until they reach the inner courtyard: the seven arches.

< Image >

Despite the time of day, it is impossible dark during your walk in the corridor, with the green light piercing through.
Now you stand in what seems like midnight, your personal time pieces will tell you to be mid-afternoon, but the sky 
is dark.

Seven stone archways stand in a neat circle in this large space.
 
Each archway is 10 metres tall and over 5 metres feet wide.

Multicolored lights of unknown provenance warp and weave across the arches’ stone faces.

Surrounding the arches is a circle of dwarf oak trees, each tree towers over the group, stretching high into the sky,
well above the arches, as if feeding off their energy or reaching for something in the sky itself.

Each tree you estimate to be at least 50 metres tall but not exceeding much more than 3 metres in width.

A glowing hempen rope tied around the tree trunks forms a barricade.

In the middle of the circle of arches, a small podium clearly used for rituals sits about 3 metres tall.

The only light is provided by floating lanterns that hang in the air.
They seem to be made of wood with dancing lights inside them that look like dozens of hectic fireflies.
