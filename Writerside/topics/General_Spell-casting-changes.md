# Spell casting changes

**IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THESE CHANGES, YOU DON'T HAVE TO!!!!!!**

"The biggest change is mostly this makes casters the ultra utility knife" - A player.

## The Spell casting overhaul.

- Unlimited Signature Spells.
- All of your spells are signature spells.
- That means that if you know a spell, you can heighten it freely by casting it from a higher-level spell slot,
  up to the maximum level of spell you can cast. 
- You can similarly cast any of its lower-level versions without learning them separately.

1. Once you prepare a spell in a single slot, you can cast it at any heightened level at the cost of a spell of that level.
2. Once you cast a spell, you can continue casting that spell with other spell slots even if the prepared slot is expended.
3. All spell slots of the same tradition are combined into a single pool for the purposes of preparation. This includes spell slots from any source such as class, archetypes, etc.

Basically prepared spell casters have flexible spell casting without the drawbacks of losing spell slots,
and spontaneous casters have all their spells counted as signature spells for the purpose of heightening.
Spell casters should have more flexibility and variety in their gameplay
as they will have more different spells prepared.

## Example of Rule #1.

You are a 9th-level wizard.

You have spell slots up to 5th level spell slots.

You have prepared Fireball in one of your 3rd level spell slots.

You can cast Fireball in any of your 3rd level spell slots as normal.

The change is that you can also cast Fireball in any of your higher-level spell slots even if Fireball is not prepared in those spell slots.

In this example, you can expend a 4th or 5th-level spell slot to cast a fireball.

You still use up the higher level expended slot.

## Example of Rule #2.

If you have a fireball prepared in a spell slot, you can continue casting the fireball spell in other spell slots
that don’t have the fireball spell even after the fireball slot has been expended.

## Example of Rule #3.

A dual-class Magus + Wizard called Bob is preparing their spells.

Both Magus and Wizard are of the arcane tradition.

This means that if Bob prepared fireball in Bob’s Magus spell slots,
then Bob could cast fireball using any of his Magus spell slots and any of his wizard spell slots.

If Bob’s classes didn't have matching traditions (such as primal and divine), then Rule #3 does not apply.

Bob would then need to prepare "heal" twice: once in primal and once in divine.
